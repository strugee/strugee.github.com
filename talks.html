            <p>An introduction to Arch Linux - why it's awesome, how to use the tools that it provides, and how to interact with the community.</p>
            <p>The presentation will roughly cover:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Arch Way (basic philosophy of the distro, etc.)</li>
              <li>A basic outline of the system installation procedure</li>
              <li>How to use pacman, the PACkage MANager, and the AUR, the Arch User Repository (where you get software not in the official repos)</li>
              <li>How to engage with the community/get help (and not get flamed)</li>

          <h2 class="talk-title">Just Do It: The Approachability of Free Software for Beginners</h2>
          <blockquote class="talk-description">
            <p>We all know that one of free software's greatest strengths is the ability to do whatever you're interested in, without asking for permission. But even though we all know, we don't talk about it that much, and in particular, we don't talk about the significance of what that strength means for those who are just beginning their programming careers.</p>
            <p>"Just Do It - The Approachability of Free Software for Beginners" will put forth the idea that the <em>only</em> tools that are approachable for beginners while still leading to the ability to produce what we would call "high quality" software are all free software tools. It will talk about the ability of free and open source software to inspire curiosity and interest and the role of that curiosity in bringing new programmers into our community. Finally, it will explore some of the areas that this model fails in, and what we can do to fix it.</p>

          <h2 class="talk-title">Pump.io + Community = ♥</h2>
          <blockquote class="talk-description">
            <p>Pump.io is a promising project to create a federated social network. It was abandoned for a while, but its maintainer has recently started transferring governance and code maintenance to the community. Come to this talk to learn details about what Pump.io is, why it's awesome, and the future plans for it.</p>
            <p>This was originally a lightning talk dealing mostly with the community, but was expanded to a full session. The extra time was used to talk a little about the history of where pump.io comes from and its API.</p>

          <h3>CryptoParty Seattle</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>CryptoParties are a global movement of people who get together to teach each other basic privacy tools, in order to ensure their right to privacy from spying eyes like Internet Service Providers, corporations like Google and Facebook, and the government (including the NSA!).</p>
            <p>Participants will learn how to protect themselves against mass surveillance with technologies like:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Tor Browser Bundle</li>
              <li>Tor Messenger</li>
              <li>Signal</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No prior experience is required.</p>
