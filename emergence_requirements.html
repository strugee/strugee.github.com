		<h1>Emergence Story Project browser requirements</h1>
		<p>
			This page lists all browser requirements that you will need to use the Emergence Story Project. This page is intended for advanced users who know about HTML5 and related technologies, and want to see exactly which the Story Project uses.
		</p>
		<p>
			Eventually, this page will become dynamic and will actually test all these items, then list out successes and faliures, similarly to the official Story Project page. It may also recommend a browser to upgrade to if some tests fail.
