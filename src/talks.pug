		h2#just-do-it.talk-title Just Do It: The Approachability of Free Software for Beginners
		blockquote.talk-description
			p We all know that one of free software's greatest strengths is the ability to do whatever you're interested in, without asking for permission. But even though we all know, we don't talk about it that much, and in particular, we don't talk about the significance of what that strength means for those who are just beginning their programming careers.
			p "Just Do It - The Approachability of Free Software for Beginners" will put forth the idea that the #[em only] tools that are approachable for beginners while still leading to the ability to produce what we would call "high quality" software are all free software tools. It will talk about the ability of free and open source software to inspire curiosity and interest and the role of that curiosity in bringing new programmers into our community. Finally, it will explore some of the areas that this model fails in, and what we can do to fix it.

		h2(id='pump.io-community').talk-title Pump.io + Community = â™¥
		blockquote.talk-description
			p Pump.io is a promising project to create a federated social network. It was abandoned for a while, but its maintainer has recently started transferring governance and code maintenance to the community. Come to this talk to learn details about what Pump.io is, why it's awesome, and the future plans for it.
			p This was originally a lightning talk dealing mostly with the community, but was expanded to a full session. The extra time was used to talk a little about the history of where pump.io comes from and its API.

		h2#stratic.talk-title Stratic - the (super-modular) streaming static site generator
		blockquote.talk-description
			p Do you like the idea of static site generators - programs that spit out HTML files that can be served by any old webserver, #[em without] invoking a huge steaming pile of PHP - but find that Jekyll is way overcomplicated? Wintersmith too monolithic? Perhaps Pelican isn't flexible enough?
			p If the above sounds like you, and you appreciate Node.js and the npm ecosystem's preference for small modules (aka the #[a(href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Doug_McIlroy_on_Unix_programming') Unix Philosophy]), you'll love working with Stratic. This talk will teach you about a new kind of static site generator that, instead of reinventing the world (or wrapping it with brand-new plugins), builds on top of existing npm modules in order to provide you with greater modularity, flexibility, and clarity than any monolithic static site generator can hope to offer. Best of all, there's no steep learning curve: if you already know Gulp.js - and it isn't that hard to pick up - then you already know how to use Stratic.

			p CryptoParties are a global movement of people who get together to teach each other basic privacy tools, in order to ensure their right to privacy from spying eyes like Internet Service Providers, corporations like Google and Facebook, and the government (including the NSA!).
			p Participants will learn how to protect themselves against mass surveillance with technologies like:
			ul
				li Tor Browser Bundle
				li Tor Messenger
				li Signal
			p No prior experience is required.
