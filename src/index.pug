		h2#hi Hi!
		p Heyo, I'm <span class="p-name">AJ Jordan</span>, sometimes known as Alex. I'm 20, live in Washington, and write code, often with my buddy <a href="http://jacksondc.com">Jackson</a>. Love that guy.

		h2#interesting Q: Shut up about yourself, do you have anything interesting to show me?
		p A: Yes! Take a look at the <a href="projects/">projects</a> page.
		p Note: this section is specifically aimed towards those of you who will think about accusing me of not having real content, and will make a remark about <a href="http://catb.org/esr/html-hell.html">retiring to Aruba tomorrow with a bevy of supermodels</a>.

		h2#passions Passions of mine
		p I like to write code. I primarily prefer to write projects in JavaScript, and consider myself pretty good at it. I'm a very big Unix fan and use the commandline for virtually everything (I frequently use GNU coreutils - stuff like <code>ls</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>cp</code>, etc. - instead of a graphical file manager).
		p Along with <a href="/projects/">the coding projects</a> that I work on, I also do a lot of system administration work. I selfhost virtually every major online service I use, and I'm also interested in the <a href="https://mediagoblin.org/news/userops.html">userops movement</a> as a way to empower less technically-inclined people to do the same. In a similar vein, I'm extremely interested in federated networks and spend a large portion of my free time contributing to <a href="http://pump.io">pump.io</a> in particular.
		p This is probably obvious by now, but I'm a vocal supporter of digital freedom. I believe in sticking to my values and I choose my digital products carefully with a lens towards whether they respect my fundamental rights to privacy, security, and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">software freedom</a>.
		p Finally, I very much enjoy dance, poetry, and photography - I prefer traditional black and white film.

		h2#learn Stuff I want to learn
		p Like I said, I love code. So here's an incomplete, unorganized list of technologies that I want to learn:
		ul
			li Plan 9-style C
			li Rust
			li Haskell
			li Common Lisp
			li Pony
			li Limbo
			li Perl
			li Smalltalk
			li x86 assembly

		p ...and also some technologies that I'm <em>vaguely</em> interested in learning at some point:
		ul
			li Vala (and associated technologies)
			li GTK+
			li Crystal
			li Scheme
			li PHP - basically so I can contribute to existing projects using it.

		p ...and also some technologies that I've learned to varying degrees but want to learn more of:
		ul
			li HTML/CSS/JavaScript - I know these fairly well, but I could improve. (I could also get way better at website design, although I'm pretty happy with this site's weird style - try the buttons in the lower-right, maybe?)
			li node.js
			li POSIX sh
			li C
			li Java, mostly for Android development
			li Python
			li DebHelper
			li ELisp
			li Brainfuck

		h2#steevie steevie
		p To run my selfhosted stuff, I run a server called steevie. steevie is supposed to be a traditional UNIX server (in addition to his duties as a server server), which isn't really relevant anymore - now that you can run Xorg on a laptop without swapping - but still fun. He has a longish history of installations, but he currently runs Debian Stretch.
