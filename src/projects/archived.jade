	h1 Archived projects

	p Projects that are either a) abandoned or b) complete but not interesting or relevant enough to be on the #[a(href='/projects') main projects page].

	section
		h2 Completed projects

		h3
			a(href='http://easyc.saasrobotics.com/') EasyC
		p EasyC is a web application that was written by me and a friend for our robotics club. Essentially, it lets builders create prototype code with a drag-and-drop interface that's reminiscent of NXT-G. (It's in the completed section because it was, at one time, complete. However, it's since broken and we haven't bothered to fix it.)

	section
		h2 Former ongoing projects

		h3
			a(href='https://github.com/strugee/PKGBUILD') PKGBUILDs
		p Various <code>PKGBUILD</code>s I've written for the AUR. Abandoned because I no longer use Arch Linux (though it's a very fine distribution).

	section
		h2 Incomplete projects

		h3
			a(href='https://github.com/strugee/pacdl') pacdl
		p Python script to automatically download Arch GNU/Linux package updates without risking system breakage. Suitable for automated use with e.g. cron. Abandoned (again) because I no longer use Arch Linux.
		
		h3
			a(href='https://github.com/strugee/HackVCR-server') HackVCR
		p HackVCR can be thought of as screencasts on steroids. The idea is that instead of recording raw pixels, we should record keystokes in editors and frames in browsers. Then you can programmatically decide what happens with the "screencast" - e.g. how the windows are laid out, having only one window visible (useful when nothing is happening in the browser/editor), etc.
		p HackVCR uses a client-server model, where the server is a daemon that runs on the user's computer and the client is an editor extension or a browser extension. It uses a custom protocol reminiscent of SMTP, and runs over a Unix socket that, by default, sits in <code>/tmp</code>. Currently a very basic server is mostly implemented.

	section
		h2 School projects
		p These have been put into their own section because they are, frankly, mostly boring.

		h3
			a(href='textingwhiledriving/') Texting While Driving
		p For a Health project, I created a PSA website on texting while driving. It's written almost completely from scratch, only using a base of HTML5 Boilerplate, Twitter Bootstrap, and Font Awesome.

		h3
			a(href='dichotomous-key/') Dichotomous Key
		p Have you ever not known what programming language you were using? No problem. Use this hacky, buggy, over-verbose, aggressively non-DRY and overall terrible dichotomous key I built, for when we were learning about dichotomous keys in my Lab Science class.

		h3
			a(href='tidal-waves/') Tidal &amp; Wave Power
		p All you ever wanted to know about tidal/wave power. This site is intended as a reference, and was created for a Lab Science project with the assistance of a friend.

		h3
			a(href='boeing-pollution/') Boeing &amp; Pollution
		p Informational website on the pollution impacts of Boeing in Washington.
