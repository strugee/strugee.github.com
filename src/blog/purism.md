In the past year I have replaced my late 2011 MacBook Pro (15"), which had honestly gotten pretty unusable, with a [Purism Librem 15](https://puri.sm/products/librem-15/). I don't normally write technology reviews in such a formal way as this but I'm making an exception so other potential buyers know exactly what they're buying, because my overall impression of the laptop is this: it works _amazingly_ when it works. But it can be a big problem when it doesn't.

# What's great

I want to first cover what is super great about this laptop, because there really is a _lot_ to like. Overall the thing performs very well. I have some pretty intense workloads - I often am running Firefox, Tor Browser, and Signal Desktop (which uses Electron and therefore embeds Chromium) all at the same time. My Firefox almost always has many hundreds of tabs and I usually have multiple terminal windows open. Plus I have a couple databases running in the background, and to top it all off, I run GNOME Shell which uses some pretty intense visual effects. The Librem 15 is able to handle all this like a champion.

I also really seriously enjoy the hardware kill switches. I can't really imagine myself using the networking switch that much (and so far I haven't, basically at all), but the camera/microphone switch is a godsend. I have found that I need to use those infrequently enough that when I do, it sometimes takes me a minute to remember to flip the switch, but I expect this to get less important with time. Plus, it's small potatoes to how safe I feel knowing that even if my operating system is completely compromised, a random attacker can't watch me or listen to me.

Finally the physical design of the laptop is quite nice. It's sleek and lightweight and the keyboard is actually pretty decent, especially after I loosened a screw on the bottom - it's very sensitive to how tightly the screws are screwed in, and before I made the change, the space bar was quite stiff.

This is why I say it works amazingly when it works. It's really an amazing machine. But I've also had a fair amount of negative experiences, so let's get into those.

# Preorder delays

The first problem I had with Purism is the shipping delays with the laptop. I preordered the laptop around March, expecting it to arrive early to mid summer. Instead, it arrived in early September.

Of course, part of that delay I expected, because it was a preorder. When Purism [announced](https://puri.sm/posts/ship-from-inventory-has-begun/) they had started shipping from inventory, I was super excited. But my laptop didn't come... and didn't come. Finally after some back-and-forth, I received a link to a forum post explaining shipment delays. This was super helpful to understand, but I wish Purism had proactively contacted me to explain the delays, instead of leaving me to wonder. (An email just pointing me at the forum post that said "btw, if your laptop hasn't shipped, we're still working on it and here's a summary of why" would've worked great.) At some point I also got an email asking me to confirm my shipping address. I didn't notice said email, which delayed my order further. This was obviously my fault, but it would've been nice for Purism to proactively reach out to me so they could fulfill my order.

I also learned more recently about [the bugs](https://puri.sm/posts/coreboot-on-the-skylake-librems-part-2/) had caused some of the initial shipping delays for my laptop. This actually explained a lot and made me feel better about the process, but I would've appreciated more proactive communication.

As far as I can tell the root cause here was havoc caused by a new model launch, which is totally understandable. This problem was exacerbated by communication that was... less than ideal. For anyone buying Purism laptops now (i.e. not a preorder), I am _guessing_ but am of course not positive that this will not be an issue for you. But it's something to keep in mind.
