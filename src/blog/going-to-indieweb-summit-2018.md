Once again, I'll be <data class="p-rsvp" value="yes">attending</data> the <a href="https://2018.indieweb.org/" class="u-in-reply-to">IndieWeb Summit</a> this year. Probably I'll work on [lazymention](https://github.com/strugee/lazymention) and the [`social-stream` branch](https://github.com/strugee/strugee.github.com/tree/social-stream) of this website. Maybe I'll work on [Stratic](https://stratic.js.org/) too! I'm super excited.
