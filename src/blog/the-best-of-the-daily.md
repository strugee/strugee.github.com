Recently I recommended the New York Times' podcast [The Daily][] to some coworkers (I _love_ this podcast; if you known me in real life you know I talk about it literally _all the time_). I also said I would send one of them recommendations for what I think are the best episodes. But rather than do all that typing on a phone for only one person, I figured I would just put them on my blog instead! So here's a list of what are, in my opinion, some of the best episodes of The Daily in the 2 and a half years since I started listening to it[1].

This list is organized in chronological order and may be updated in the future as The Daily makes new episodes or when I remember others I particularly enjoyed.

This is undoubtedly one of my favorites, if not my all-time favorite episode of The Daily. It deals with something more basic than just news stories: the fundamental right to free speech and a free press, and why those are important to have for democracy - and how recent U.S. presidents have threatened this fundamental right. I would _highly_ recommend the entire episode, but there's one quote I find particularly powerful. Michael Barbaro, the host of The Daily, asks, "but isn't there a very good reason that it's illegal to leak classified information? That there's a national security that has to be accounted for and that from the perspective of federal government, isn't it logical that they act really swiftly and with some level of secrecy, to try to get to the bottom of something that has life-or-death consequences?" Here's Matt Apuzzo's response:

> Absolutely. _However_. I don't want people to hear this and say, oh boo hoo. Matt Apuzzo and Adam Goldman couldn't get their calls returned to report on national security secrets. Big deal. Because it _is_ a big deal. And here's why. Let's go back for a minute to the aftermath of 9/11... if you didn't have people willing to have those conversations with reporters, we wouldn't know about warrantless wiretapping, or [CIA] black sites, or torture, or the abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison, the abuses at Guantanamo Bay, the use of drones to kill people anywhere in the world, the use of drones to kill an American citizen, [extraordinary rendition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_rendition), I mean the list goes on. and if you didn't know those things, we wouldn't have _any idea_ what our government was doing. I mean imagine taking all of those things out of the public mind. And then we go, what, we go out on election day and we think we're making an informed vote? We have no _idea_ what's happening if reporters can have those conversations. **then the only thing you know... is what the White House says from the press briefing**.

# July 8th, 2019 - [The Trial of a Navy SEAL Chief](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/podcasts/the-daily/navy-seal-edward-gallagher-trial.html)

> The trial of Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, a decorated member of the Navy SEALs, offered rare insight into a culture that is, by design, difficult to penetrate. Our colleague tells us what he learned from the not-guilty verdict.
