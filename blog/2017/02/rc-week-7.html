<h3 id="day-23">Day 23</h3>
<p>Arrived ~10:00, departed ~21:45, total time at RC 11h45m.</p>
<p>Didn't get a whole lot done today, mostly because we were all welcoming the Spring 1s - I went out to lunch with some of them and participated in Code Dojo in the afternoon (<a href="https://github.com/adityavkk">Aditya</a> and I solved the challenge in <code>bash</code>, which was pretty interesting an also hilarious[1]). However, I did do some maintenance on <a href="https://gplenforced.org">gplenforced.org</a>. I did, however, start a project to display activity in 455 Broadway in realtime which I'm pretty exited about.</p>
<p> [1]: Aditya asked me "so can you just cast a string to an integer in <code>bash</code> or...?" and when I said no he looked at me and asked how in the world we could complete this task - not realizing that the correct question is, of course, "does <code>bash</code> have a type system?" The answer to which is no, no it does not.</p>
<h3 id="day-24">Day 24</h3>
<p>Arrived ~14:30, departed ~1:10, total time at RC 10h40m.</p>
<p>Spent most of today working on realtime.recurse.com - I got the basic API working, so you can POST to the server and it'll handle expiry properly. Also spent a lot of time blogging for the Iron Blogger meeting (in which I got sentenced to use <code>vim</code> for the week instead of Emacs for not writing a post a couple weeks ago).</p>
<h3 id="day-25">Day 25</h3>
<p>Arrived ~10:30, departed ~19:10, total time at RC 8h40m.</p>
<p>Spent the day catching up on various things, notably putting out a new pump.io beta that backported some regression fixes. In the evening I spent most of my time finishing up a mid-year college application form before videocalling with a friend in college.</p>
<h3 id="day-26">Day 26</h3>
<p>Arrived ~10:35, departed ~1:05, total time at RC 14h30m.</p>
<p>Spent some time working on server stuff today. Other than that though I didn't do much of anything.</p>
<h3 id="friday">Friday</h3>
<p>Arrived ~16:20, departed ~1:45, total time at RC 9h25m. As always, Friday doesn't count as a day because RC is technically not in session.</p>
<p>Worked on <a href="https://github.com/straticjs/generator-stratic">generator-stratic</a> today. I fixed some bugs and disabled some functionality that wasn't complete (and was non-trivial to complete). Published a beta 0 in the evening.</p>
<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h3>
<p>This week was... <em>okay</em> in terms of productivity. It started off relatively good, slipped a fair amount in the middle, and then somewhat came back at the end of the week. I did, however, check off some semi-longstanding issues on my todo list. So that's nice.</p>
<p>Total time at RC 55 hours 0 minutes; cumulative time 294 hours 25 minutes.</p>
