<hr>
<p>Throughout my time at RC I&#x27;ve noticed only one thing is consistently difficult for me: focusing on hard things. Intellectually I love the idea of challenging myself. And I find that when I start to work on things that are new and not easy, it feels good and I tend to keep working on those things, because they&#x27;re interesting. But starting is something that I just don&#x27;t do frequently enough, and so I find that I haven&#x27;t progressed as a programmer nearly as much as I would like to have.</p>
<p>What is productivity?</p>
<p>Merriam-Webster defines it like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the quality or state of being productive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the rate per unit area or per unit volume at which biomass consumable as food by other organisms is made by producers</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>And &#x22;productive&#x22; is defined like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>having the quality or power of producing, especially in abundance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective in bringing about</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a) yielding results, benefits, or profits; b) yielding or devoted to the satisfaction of wants or the creation of utilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to be used in the formation of new words or constructions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>raising mucus or sputum (as from the bronchi)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>By definitions 1-3 I certainly seem to have been productive; I&#x27;ve written a lot of code, much of which is useful. But useful to <em>whom</em>, and for what purpose?</p>
<p>I sometimes feel as if I&#x27;m just generating more and more code without any guiding process, as though I&#x27;m wasting my time even though concretely I&#x27;m getting a <em>lot</em> of things done - driftless even though I&#x27;m churning out work at an extremely high rate. Is this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">imposter syndrome</a>? Or are my worries legitimate?</p>
<p>Maybe a better way to frame this question is to split it in two - am I being productive for myself, and am I being productive for the community - the two things that are currently important to me personally.</p>
<p>I think I am failing at being productive for myself, in some really important ways. I&#x27;m also succeeding in some - for example, I used to wish I had an engine to run my blog, and now I have <a href="https://github.com/straticjs">such an engine</a>. But in others I am failing.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of RC? Why am I here?</p>
<hr>
<p>recurse.com <a href="https://www.recurse.com/about#who-comes-to-the-recurse-center">says this</a> about people who come to RC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Recurse Center is for people who want to become better programmers. We are not startup school nor are we a bootcamp: Our focus is helping people become better programmers, not building prototypes, and we&#x27;re not a training program for web developers.</p>
<p>Because there is no certification or grading, the only reason to come to the Recurse Center is to become a better programmer. As such, you will find kindred spirits and tremendous energy. We look for smart, friendly, self-directed, intellectually curious people who enjoy programming and want to get dramatically better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More directly, <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual">the manual</a> has this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should be here primarily because you want to become a better programmer and spend the majority of your time here programming and doing things directly related to programming.</p>
<p>Well, we could ask you to be respectful of speakers and keep conversations on-topic in the Recurse Center space during the day (i.e. if you want to take a break and chat about your weekend, go grab a coffee).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, as <a href="https://haroldtreen.com">Harold</a> points out, that <a href="https://haroldtreen.com/tech/recurse/2017/01/27/recurse-center-return-statement/">isn&#x27;t necessarily an accurate picture</a> of what RC is about. I think a lot of what it&#x27;s really about is the people who are in the space with you. I&#x27;ve sure had a wonderful time with the people. Does that mean I&#x27;m &#x22;succeeding&#x22;?</p>
<p>Then there&#x27;s the teaching.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/anja-teaching.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a Zulip message where Anja says &#x22;thank you AJ for teaching us so many things. :)&#x22;"></p>
<p>This is referring to the fact that I teach at Security Club every week, plus my volunteering to run a workshop or two for Beginner&#x27;s Club and Web Dev 101.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, I get very, very little out of teaching at RC. Sometimes it helps solidify (or just plain remind me of) the concepts I teach, but this is the exception, not the norm. So in that sense by spending time teaching, I&#x27;m &#x22;failing&#x22; at being productive for myself. But it seems clear to me that people get a lot out of the time I spend, so I seem to be very productive for the community.</p>
<p>Equally importantly I <em>love</em> teaching. I qualified the previous paragraph with &#x22;practically speaking&#x22; because emotionally teaching is something that&#x27;s very beneficial to me. Does that mean I&#x27;m &#x22;succeeding&#x22;? Does it mean I&#x27;m &#x22;failing&#x22; and &#x22;succeeding&#x22; at the same time?</p>
<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know.</p>
