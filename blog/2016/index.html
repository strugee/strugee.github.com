            <h2 class="p-name">Pump.io 1.0.0 is now available</h2></a>
          <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Alex Jordan</a> and categorized as <a href="/blog/category/development/">development</a> and <a href="/blog/category/pump.io/">pump.io</a>
          </p>
          <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/releases/tag/v1.0.0">Pump.io 1.0.0</a> is officially available! Whoooo!</p>
<p>I just wanted to write up an announcement real quick to celebrate. Here&#39;s a sample what&#39;s gone into this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Node 4.x support</li>
<li>Lots of security improvements including a better cross-site scripting scrubber and security-related headers that help protect the web UI (most notably, the web UI now declares a Content Security Policy)</li>
<li>Minor improvements to the API to make it (slightly) smarter</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/">LibreJS</a> support</li>
<li>Numerous dependency upgrades, most notably Connect</li>
<li>And of course, tons of minor bugfixes and improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details, see the brand-new <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#100---2016-08-26">change log</a>.</p>
<p>And of course since we&#39;re now past 0.x.x releases, we&#39;re now officially making a commitment to the community to make only API-compatible changes going forward (or at least, until 2.0.0!).</p>
<p>As this release <em>does</em> improve security and fixes a lot of bugs, node administrators are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible. If you have a global, npm-based install, you can upgrade with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo npm install -g pump.io
</code></pre><p>And with a source-based install:</p>
<pre><code>git pull
git checkout v1.0.0
npm install --production
</code></pre><p>If you&#39;re upgrading from 0.3.0, everything should Just Work(tm). Don&#39;t forget to restart your daemon!</p>
<p>One final note - the rumors are true. While we&#39;re not doing so <em>yet</em>, we are, in fact, planning to deprecate running under Node.js 0.10 and 0.12 very soon. Also, if you upgrade to Node.js 4.x early, the new, better XSS scrubber will be enabled - <em>however</em>, be aware that pump.io is far less tested under Node.js 4.x and you are likely to run into more bugs than you would under 0.10 or 0.12. This is an unfortunate situation, but sadly there&#39;s really nothing to be done about it. :(</p>
<p>Special thanks to Menno Vossen, Laura Arjona, Evan Prodromou, Jan Kusanagi and all the other volunteers who did so many different things to make this release happen. It truly wouldn&#39;t have happened without you.</p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>
<p>With &lt;3,</p>
<p>AJ</p>

            <h2 class="p-name">Pump.io: call for testers, call for feedback</h2></a>
          <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Alex Jordan</a> and categorized as <a href="/blog/category/development/">development</a> and <a href="/blog/category/pump.io/">pump.io</a>
          </p>
          <div class="e-content"><p>So in my <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2016/08/new-stuff-in-pump.io">last post</a>, I mentioned that I&#39;d left a couple things for a second blog post. This is that post, and instead of being about all the cool stuff going on in the pumpiverse, it&#39;s about stuff that you - yes, <em>you</em>! - can do! It&#39;s super easy too.</p>
<h2 id="call-for-testers">Call for testers</h2>
<p>So as I mentioned, the <code>utml-to-jade</code> branch is basically finished (see <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/pull/1170">PR #1170</a>). Since switching templating languages is a huge, huge change, by definition touching every single part of the Web UI, we want to make sure it&#39;s well-tested. This is especially critical given the fact that the Web UI unfortunately has <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/issues/147">very little test coverage</a>.</p>
<p>That&#39;s where pump.io system administrators come in. If you&#39;re a sysadmin and you&#39;re willing to test this change on your node, we&#39;d very much appreciate it. There&#39;s very little risk, since I <em>think</em> I&#39;ve squashed all the regressions that happened, but you should be willing to <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/issues">report bugs</a> if you <em>do</em> run into them. In particular, you should look out for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Links that seem to encompass too much text</li>
<li>Missing spaces - e.g. <code>Alex Jordanat [date]</code> instead of <code>Alex Jordan at [date]</code></li>
<li>HTML code showing up on the page - e.g. <code>Test note&lt;br /&gt;</code> instead of <code>Test note</code> followed by a line break</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the <code>utml-to-jade</code> branch incorporates all changes in the <code>master</code> branch, so you may want to check out the advice in <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/wiki/Running-from-git-master">Running from Git master</a>.</p>
<p>Sound interesting? Want to take part in the development of pump.io? Installing is super easy:</p>
<pre><code>$ [sudo] npm install -g e14n/pump.io#utml-to-jade
</code></pre><p>This will work even if you already have a (non-source) install of pump.io - just make sure to restart the server afterwards.</p>
<p>Note that this command has some semi-terrible logic to build Jade templates on install (this is a workaround for a deficiency in npm). If you get a scary warning message from npm, please <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/issues">file an issue</a>, making sure to include the full log.</p>
<h2 id="call-for-design-feedback">Call for design feedback</h2>
<p>The other big thing that&#39;s happening is the pump.io 1.0.0 tshirt we&#39;re designing! I&#39;ve spent quite a bit of time working on a variety of candidate designs which can be viewed in <a href="https://cloud.strugee.net/index.php/s/Ymw2RAdxyFZuuwu">this ownCloud share</a>. Obviously we want the coolest tshirt possible, so we&#39;re looking for any design feedback that people have. Anyone with some spare time can glance through the designs, and we&#39;d be thrilled to get everyone&#39;s opinions.</p>
<p>If this sounds interesting, I&#39;d welcome you to check out <a href="https://cloud.strugee.net/index.php/s/Ymw2RAdxyFZuuwu">the drafts</a>. As always, get in touch with the community through <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/wiki/Community#community-accounts-communication">our chatroom</a> or if you&#39;d prefer, you can email me directly at <a href="mailto:alex@strugee.net">alex@strugee.net</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks so much! :)</p>

            <h2 class="p-name">New stuff in pump.io</h2></a>
          <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Alex Jordan</a> and categorized as <a href="/blog/category/development/">development</a> and <a href="/blog/category/pump.io/">pump.io</a>
          </p>
          <div class="e-content"><p>So I promised <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2016/05/stratic-part-one">a (long) while ago</a> that I&#39;d blog about all the stuff going on in <a href="http://pump.io">pump.io</a>. And there is a <em>lot</em> going on. Where to even begin?</p>
<h2 id="lfnw-talk">LFNW talk</h2>
<p>I think the first thing I should mention is <a href="https://linuxfestnorthwest.org/2016/sessions/pumpio-community">the talk</a> I gave at LinuxFest Northwest this year. It went really, really well (even though I finished half the slides the night before), and people seemed to be really engaged, especially during questions. It starts off by covering the history behind pump.io: that includes the relevant protocols, like OStatus and <a href="http://activitystrea.ms">ActivityStreams</a>, but also the motivation behind abandoning StatusNet (aka current GNU Social) in favor of a brand-new network. Next I move on to the way that pump.io itself works, namely, its function as a generic ActivityStreams distribution engine. To put this another way, I explain why this quote from <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/blob/master/README.md">the README</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I post something and my followers see it. That&#39;s the rough idea behind the pump.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is a pretty accurate way of describing what pump.io actually does. (I quote that quite a few times in the slides themselves.) I end with a discussion of the recent developments in the community, which are of course wonderful, and a short call-to-action for people to contribute - either directly to the software, or by joining the network and spreading pump.io.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way - the talk was recorded! So you can watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ6RVTFdYNc">on YouTube</a> or, even better, <a href="https://media.strugee.net/u/alex/m/linuxfest-northwest-2016-pump-io-the-community/">on my personal MediaGoblin</a>. Fitting, since (as I mention in the talk) MediaGoblin federation will soon be released, and it&#39;s based on (and fully interoperable with) the pump.io protocol!</p>
<h2 id="conservancy-application">Conservancy application</h2>
<p>Pump.io is applying to the <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>! This is super fantastic for us for a number of reasons. One of the biggest advantages is the fact that inside Conservancy (assuming our application is accepted), we&#39;ll be able to take donations much, much easier. This is primarily important because nodes in the pump.io network are volunteer-run, but they still require funds to operate. We&#39;re thinking about models wherein people will be able to donate to &quot;pump.io&quot;, and then some (most?) of those funds will be used to pay for the network. (In particular, they&#39;ll be used to pay for the existing E14N nodes that Evan currently runs, which will become extremely useful once we transition those nodes to community owners). Conservancy also provides useful miscellaneous services, like owning our logo and making sure that if we encounter license violations, the license is properly enforced. But perhaps most importantly, becoming part of Conservancy cements pump.io even more in the community - both the group of people working on the software &amp; network, but also the larger free software world.</p>
<h2 id="readthedocs">ReadTheDocs</h2>
<p>We&#39;ve started a <a href="http://pumpio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">dedicated space</a> for project documentation, hosted on ReadTheDocs. We&#39;re plannning to move a bunch of content from the GitHub wiki into this project, and hopefully it&#39;ll become a thorough and central place for pump.io documentation - both for users and for deployers.</p>
<h2 id="triage">Triage</h2>
<p>We&#39;ve spent quite a bit of time going through open issues and prioritizing them. A lot of issues have a release target now, and it feels really nice to feel like our issue tracker is a bit more organized.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://identi.ca/larjona">Laura Arjona</a> for driving this work.</p>
<h2 id="various-minor-code-improvements">Various minor code improvements</h2>
<p>There have been a <em>bunch</em> of small bugfixes and improvements that have gone into the <code>master</code> branch - some of them user-facing, and some of them making the development experience better. Notable changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Migrating from Connect 1.x to Connect 2.x (this is just a start - Connect 2.x is still deprecated, but it gets us closer than we were to relying on a fully non-deprecated stack)</li>
<li>JSHint is now automatically run against <code>bin/</code> and <code>routes/</code> when <code>npm test</code> is run. This makes it super obvious when there are regressions in code quality, especially in Pull Requests (since Travis CI will fail if JSHint doesn&#39;t succeed.)</li>
<li>JSCS is now used to enforce code style. It&#39;s automatically run against the entire codebase (whoo!) when you run <code>npm test</code>, and it&#39;s awesome for the same reason - much of the style-related feedback that would&#39;ve previously ended up in a Pull Request can now be dealt with directly on a local development machine, reducing PR review time for both the reviewer <em>and</em> the contributor.</li>
<li>LibreJS is now <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/pull/1058">supported</a></li>
<li>Tests now pass! Whooooooooo! (Thanks to Menno Vossen for sending <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/pull/1136">the enormous Pull Request</a> that made this happen.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are just the bigger ones, of course - there are a bunch of even smaller problems that got squashed as well. I&#39;d also like to point out that quite a few of these were long-standing PRs which <em>finally</em> made it into core, which is awesome for everyone.</p>
<h2 id="express-3-x-migration">Express 3.x migration</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve been putting in a lot of work to migrate pump.io to Express 3.x. It&#39;s a huge amount of work, but when complete, it will bring us very, very close to being able to migrate onto Express 4.x, which is modern and fully-supported by upstream. Basically what I&#39;ve been doing is just running the app, seeing where it crashes, going to the exception site, and fixing the problem. Rinse, repeat. You can check out this work on the <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/tree/express-3.x"><code>express-3.x</code></a> branch - currently, this branch can successfully start up the app, but will crash pretty soon after you try to do almost anything else.</p>
<p>This work, unfortunately, is on hold while another important project is completed: converting all the templates from utml to Jade.</p>
<h2 id="utml-to-jade-transition">utml to Jade transition</h2>
<p>This is basically what it sounds like. Previously, the templates in pump.io were based on <a href="https://github.com/mikefrey/utml">utml</a>, which is essentially a thin wrapper around <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#template">Underscore.js&#39;s <code>_.template()</code></a> function. However, utml doesn&#39;t work with Express 3.x (and it&#39;s not really worth <em>making</em> it work), plus it&#39;s not the prettiest to work with. <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a> is an extremely popular templating language in Node-land nowadays, so a couple months ago I spent somewhere between 14 and 18 hours going through and rewriting all the utml in Jade, which was absolutely brutal - but necessary. Then, of course, I had to fix the client-side templating logic to handle Jade instead of Underscore templates, which took quite a while, along with the fact that I made a very large number of minor (largely cosmetic) errors in my conversions.</p>
<p>As I said above, this was kind of awful work (<em>especially</em> the beginning), but it&#39;s necessary and great, as it paves the way for Express 3.x <em>and</em> massively improves the contributor experience.</p>
<p>You can check out the gory details of this work in <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/pull/1170">PR #1170</a>, and the original reasoning behind why we&#39;re doing this in <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/issues/1167">issue #1167</a>. This work is actually done, but I&#39;m going to write a separate blog post about it, calling for testers.</p>
<h2 id="upcoming-1-0-0-release">Upcoming 1.0.0 release</h2>
<p>Last but <strong>certainly</strong> not least, we&#39;re gearing up for our 1.0.0 release! From a codebase standpoint, this is really just a small bugfix release (although it will make a lot of things less broken and - if I recall correctly - fix the actual installation process), but more importantly, it means that we&#39;re now committing to <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>, which is a win for everyone (but especially administrators). The main thing that needs to be fixed before this goes out the door is the behavior of the XSS scrubber, which was accidentally made a little too aggressive. This is being tracked in <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/issues/1169">issue #1169</a>.</p>
<p>As a bonus, I&#39;m also designing a t-shirt that (if there&#39;s sufficient interest) we may print as a celebration of this release - but more on this in my next post.</p>

            <h2 class="p-name">Work on strugee.net</h2></a>
          <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Alex Jordan</a> and categorized as <a href="/blog/category/development/">development</a>
          </p>
          <div class="e-content"><p>I realized I forgot to blog about all the work I&#39;ve done on the <code>strugee.net</code> build code recently! I want to get back to working on Stratic part two (aka pretty indexes), but I thought I&#39;d really quickly take the time to point out what&#39;s been done.</p>
<p>First of all, even though I rewrote the code in <a href="http://jade-lang.com">Jade</a> about <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2014/12/new-blog-new-site">a year and a half ago</a>, there was still a huge amount of boilerplate code in each Jade file. Why? Because essentially the way I did that was by running each HTML file through an <a href="http://html2jade.aaron-powell.com/">HTML to Jade</a> converter, then manually fixing up the result to be, you know, less ugly. That meant that common stuff, like the navbar, footer, includes, etc. were all duplicated across all Jade files. And that sucks, because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself</a> is a thing.</p>
<p>Luckily, refactoring is a thing too! So a few weeks ago, I went and split out the common site layout into <a href="https://github.com/strugee/strugee.github.com/blob/c5ec1634a6b038eec25adb5abcd2b578a60ec4fd/src/includes/layout.jade">its own Jade file</a>, then made all the individual pages inherit from that common layout. The most difficult part of this was undoubtedly the navigation bar - I was pretty sure I&#39;d have to just deal with the fact that the navbar was duplicated across pages (because each page has to have a different link deactivated), but then inspiration struck, and I ended up witht the solution I have now. Instead of treating the entire navigation as one block, I treat each <em>link</em> as a block that is overridable via Jade&#39;s <code>block</code> directive. And, since Jade <code>block</code>s can have defaults, each page only overrides exactly what it needs to, and the rest of the links are automatically there and properly clickable.</p>
<p>This has a couple nice side effects. The first is that the codebase that generates <code>strugee.net</code> is now <em>extremely</em> easy for me to change, regardless of what part of the site I touch (whereas before, individual pages were pretty easy but changing e.g. the navbar require editing each and every individual page). The second (and clearly the most important) is that Night Mode, which I implemented in a 45-minute class <em>over two years ago</em> now (back when I was still in high school - what a crazy thing to think about not being in high school anymore!) now works on every page across all of <code>strugee.net</code>. Whooo! Silly hacks are at the core of the web, right? Might as well make them work well.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#39;d be remiss if I didn&#39;t mention that I now have a proper <a href="https://github.com/strugee/strugee.github.com/blob/c5ec1634a6b038eec25adb5abcd2b578a60ec4fd/gulpfile.js#L128"><code>deploy</code> task</a>, so I can abandon the sketchy and genuinely terrible deploy process that I used before. (For those curious: <code>gulp build &amp;&amp; git checkout master &amp;&amp; mv dist/*.html . &amp;&amp; git commit -m &quot;Some bad commit message&quot; &amp;&amp; git push &amp;&amp; git checkout src</code> - not shown here are the several attempts where I made some typo or possibly didn&#39;t think of some files in <code>dist/</code> that changed and so should have been <code>mv</code>&#39;d, but weren&#39;t.) And, I now use root-relative includes now, e.g. <code>/js/main.js</code> instead of <code>js/main.js</code>, which is another win for DRY because now I don&#39;t have to maintain different header contents for subpages (which used to be the exact same, just with <code>../</code> prepended to all paths).</p>
<p>In conclusion: yay for progress! And yay for the fact that my codebase actually looks like someone competent wrote it! \o/</p>
<p>(Final note: I haven&#39;t forgotten my promise to blog about stuff happening in pump.io-land. But, not now.)</p>

</code></pre><p>How <em>gorgeous</em> is that?? Let me explain how it works. (I&#39;ll assume the reader is familiar with <a href="https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp">Gulp</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>.)</p>
<p>So the <code>gulp.src()</code> call is pretty obvious. We just read all the blog posts into the stream. Note, however, that <code>gulp.src()</code> doesn&#39;t stream text, per se - it streams <a href="https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl">Vinyl</a> file objects. This will become important later.</p>
<p>Now, the first piece of custom Stratic code that we use is the <code>stratic-parse-header</code> module. This module takes a Markdown file with a standard Stratic header (see <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2014/11/new-blog-new-site">my original announcement</a> for details), parses the header, strips it out, then returns the new, headerless Markdown. However, the new Vinyl file object has a couple of new properties from the parsing phase - specifically, <code>file.title</code>, <code>file.author</code>, <code>file.time</code>, and <code>file.categories</code> now exist. This is why the fact that Vinyl is used is important - now <em>any</em> Gulp plugin downstream from where <code>parse()</code> is run can use all of these values in whatever way it wants. (See <a href="https://github.com/strugee/stratic-parse-header/blob/master/README.md">the README</a> for more details.)</p>
<p>Now our Vinyl file object is <em>only</em> the content of the post, and it has additional Stratic metadata attached to it. Awesome! The next thing that we do is render the Markdown, just using a standard Gulp plugin for this. Easy breezy. After that, we pipe to the <code>stratic-date-in-path</code> module, which adds the year and month to paths. For example, without <code>stratic-date-in-path</code>, this blog post would be at <code>https://strugee.net/blog/stratic-part-one</code>. However, since I <em>do</em> use <code>stratic-date-in-path</code>, the post lives at <code>https://strugee.net/blog/2016/05/stratic-part-one</code> instead. Nice, right? Eventually I&#39;ll write code to generate pretty indexes for each year and month - that&#39;s what Stratic part 2 is for.</p>
<p>The next thing we do is pipe to the <code>stratic-post-to-json-data</code> module. This module is specifically designed to work with the <code>gulp-jade-template</code> module, which expects the file contents to be some JSON that will be given as data to a <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a> template, whose rendered HTML becomes the new file contents. What sets up that JSON? You guessed it - <code>stratic-post-to-json-data</code>. That&#39;s all it does. It just creates an object that contains the metadata and the actual post text, runs it through <code>JSON.stringify()</code>, and sets the file contents equal to the result. Just how <code>gulp-jade-template</code> likes it.</p>
<p>And with that, we&#39;ve successfully rendered a blog post. Whooooooooooo! I&#39;m so pumped about this software. The call to <code>rename()</code> is just a little housekeeping, and then we write the whole thing back to disk with <code>gulp.dest()</code>. Awesome.</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that the real beauty in this code isn&#39;t what the code actually does, but the extreme modularity of the whole thing. Unlike projects like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or even <a href="http://wintersmith.io/">Wintersmith</a>, this isn&#39;t a giant, monolithic framework. It&#39;s all standard Node and Gulp. Note how (for example) we didn&#39;t need a custom plugin for Markdown - we just used the standard <code>gulp-markdown</code>. Don&#39;t like Markdown? No problem. Write something to extract post metadata from your preferred format, replace <code>parse()</code> with that and <code>markdown()</code> with a different renderer, and you&#39;re golden. All the rest will continue to work the <em>exact</em> same - adding dates to paths, rendering the template, etc. - because everything&#39;s decoupled from everything else. Each component can be trivially swapped out and replaced with something new and better, and the rest of the system continues to work. Gorgeous.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got to go now, but I&#39;m not done blogging. I&#39;ll be back soon to talk about the work going on in <a href="http://pump.io/">pump.io</a>, and I&#39;ll be back (much?) later to talk about Stratic part two (aka, pretty indexes).</p>
<p>Whooooooooooooooooooooo!</p>

<p>I get asked all the time what I think of BitCon…this guy says it better than I could.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>+1 for linking to something by Alex Payne. I love him.</p>
<p>About the actual content, at one point Alex says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re told that Bitcoin “fixes serious problems with existing payment systems that depend on centralized services to verify the validity of transactions.” If by “fixes” you mean “ignores”, then yes: a Bitcoin transaction, like cash, comes with the certainty that a definite quantity of a store of value has changed hands, and little else. How this verifies any “validity” or cuts down on fraud I’m not sure; stolen Bitcoins are spent as easily as stolen cash, which is why <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2013/11/20/more-bitcoins-more-problems-how-hackers-are-targeting-bitcoins.html">theft of Bitcoins has been rampant</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the concern isn’t with fraud or validity. The problem that Bitcoin solves is with the centralized banking model. The fundamental idea behind Bitcoin is that it cannot be centrally controlled or taken down, like the internet. It is impossible to flip a switch and “turn off” the Bitcoin network. It <em>is</em> possible to do that with a centralized bank: in that case, “flipping the switch” ends up being “shut down the bank”. Or, “drive the bank out of business”.</p>
<pre><code>If Bitcoin’s strength comes from decentralization, why pour millions into a single company? Ah, because Coinbase provides an “accessible interface to the Bitcoin protocol”, we’re told. We must centralize to decentralize, you see; such is the perverse logic of capital co-opting power. In order for Bitcoin to grow a thriving ecosystem, it apparently needs a US-based, VC-backed company that has “worked closely with banks and regulators to ensure that the service is safe and compliant”.
</code></pre><p>Maybe the problem isn’t with Bitcoin itself, but with what Coinbase is doing with the Bitcoin protocol. Now, to be clear, I think the Bitcoin to USD bridge aspect of Coinbase is OK. But I think that this paragraph is very, very true: it is <em>perverse</em> that we have centralized a decentralized protocol. Decentralized protocols tend to be very dangerous, IMHO, because of the tendency of users to just go with the most popular provider because it’s the easiest solution, and then effectively centralizing the network in the process.</p>
<p>Anyone remember XMPP? XMPP was supposed to be great. It was supposed to be the future of communications on the internet. But in practice, XMPP servers are unreliable. It’s hard to find one that works well. I don’t actually use XMPP a lot myself, but there are a lot of problems with connections, chat requests being undone (so you have to add a contact for a second time), etc. So what happened because of these problems (and the fact that everyone uses Gmail)? The most-used XMPP server is talk.google.com. At least it was, until Google replaced Google Talk with Google Hangouts, which uses a proprietary protocol with no XMPP bridge - and so the network got screwed over, because suddenly, a lot of people upgraded to Hangouts and cut themselves off from the XMPP network. The sad truth, though, is that it almost doesn’t matter. Take a survey of any random Google Talk user. I will bet you $100 that less than 1 out of 50 people who you talk to won’t know that Google Talk is based on XMPP, much less what XMPP is. And there’s almost zero chance that they understand why XMPP matters, or why federated protocols and networks matter.</p>
<p>I’m getting off track, though. So back to Bitcoin and Coinbase. I think what Coinbase is doing by hosting people’s Bitcoin wallets and transactions is fundamentally <em>wrong</em>, because I truly believe that it damages the Bitcoin ecosystem. The centralization in Coinbase is, IMHO, a major problem.</p>
<p>I wonder if this will be solved with a project like <a href="https://arkos.io/">arkOS</a>. I mean, maybe the solutionv that will ultimately happen is for people to spin up their own instances of a Coinbase-like Bitcoin wallet. I think it’s pretty clear that people, in general, like cloud apps better than desktop apps. Access from any computer is a really nice feature to have. Maybe projects like arkOS will help decentralized protocols like Bitcoin remain decentralized in practice.</p>
<p>Or maybe Bitcoin will effectively die, just like XMPP did. I mean, sure, XMPP is still a network. But no one really uses it consciously. Almost everyone who uses XMPP nowadays does so accidentally, through a service that just happens to have an XMPP bridge. Google Talk was a prime example of this, but it’s dead. Now, I’ll bet money that the most-used XMPP provider is Facebook. Never knew that Facebook Chat had an XMPP bridge? That’s because Facebook doesn’t advertise it; the only time it’s mentioned is in the developer docs. The mainstream does not care about the XMPP protocol, because we centralized it. What the mainstream <em>does</em> care about is the services that we centralized it on: Google and Facebook. And that’s a real problem.</p>
