          <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author" class="p-author h-card">AJ Jordan</a> on 
            <time datetime="2016-11-09T14:18:12-08:00"><a href="/blog/2016/11/">November</a> 9, <a href="/blog/2016/">2016</a></time> in <a href="/blog/category/musings/" class="p-category">musings</a>
          </p>
          <div class="e-content"><p>For a while now I&#x27;ve been avoiding using the term &#x22;free software.&#x22;</p>
<p>Why? It&#x27;s just plain confusing to people. I know Richard Stallman will tell you that it means freedom, not gratis. <em>It doesn&#x27;t matter</em>. It&#x27;s still ambiguous and needlessly conflates two different concepts.</p>
<p>Instead of &#x22;free software,&#x22; I propose &#x22;freedom-respecting software&#x22; as a replacement. This phrasing is not only unambigous, it also does a much more effective job of communicating the general meaning of the term without further explanation. (Of course you&#x27;ll probably still need to explain it, but you&#x27;ll have to spend a lot less time doing so.) The one problem with this phrasing is that it&#x27;s longer, but even that doesn&#x27;t hold water - because of the aformentioned problems with &#x22;free software,&#x22; people actually don&#x27;t say &#x22;free software&#x22; all that much; instead, they say &#x22;free (as in freedom) software&#x22; which is unambiguous, but awkward on multiple levels. Not only is it a less eloquent way of describing the concept, but gramatically speaking it&#x27;s really terrible as it puts a parenthetical qualifier in-between an adjective and a noun, which just sounds <em>terrible</em> and unnatural. Seriously, say both of them out loud. &#x22;Freedom-respecting software&#x22; and &#x22;free (as in freedom) software&#x22; - which one sounds like less of a mouthful?</p>
<p>Hence, I think &#x22;free software&#x22; as a term should be considered harmful, and replaced with &#x22;freedom-respecting software&#x22; instead.</p>
<p><em>Edit 0:58 10/10/16:</em></p>
<p>Another advantage of &#x22;freedom-respecting software&#x22; is that it&#x27;s still closely related to the old term, allowing for a much easier pivot. Consider &#x22;libre software&#x22; which AFAICT had the same goals as this proposal but never really took off - in part, I think, because it sounds very different from an already-established term. (Another way of putting this is that it&#x27;s conceptually an improvement to an existing term instead of being something <em>brand-new</em>, and therefore all existing associations will carry over with far more ease.)</p>
<p>I&#x27;d also point out that the problem of ambiguity is more serious than I&#x27;ve said above. First of all, generally speaking I&#x27;m suspicious of any proposal or argument that begins or ends with &#x22;we just need to educate people more.&#x22; Education is an important part of the freedom-respecting software movement - remember, that movement is by and for the people - but I think that argument is too frequently simply an excuse for a poor initial design. (Security, I&#x27;m looking at you.) Second, such an ambiguity also muddles our search results. When people search for &#x22;free software&#x22; they <em>do</em> get our stuff (a fact that I was pleasantly surprised by!) but they also get loads and loads of pages for gratis Windows crapware. That&#x27;s unideal and it is unlikely to change, ever. Even if people <em>were</em> able to readily grasp the distinction between freedom and gratis that we&#x27;re pitching, we will never, ever have enough influence on the language people use to get them to <em>stop</em> using &#x22;free&#x22; to mean gratis - which means that Google will continue showing gratis crapware as &#x22;free software.&#x22;</p>
<p>Finally, as <a href="https://github.com/nylira/prism-break/issues/1601">pointed out</a> by some excellent PRISM Break contributors, me writing this blog post and then talking about it occasionally is a <em>far</em> dumber idea than directly contacting the FSF, which I now intend to do Real Soon Now&#x2122;.</p>
