<blockquote>
<p>I get asked all the time what I think of BitCon…this guy says it better than I could.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>+1 for linking to something by Alex Payne. I love him.</p>
<p>About the actual content, at one point Alex says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re told that Bitcoin “fixes serious problems with existing payment systems that depend on centralized services to verify the validity of transactions.” If by “fixes” you mean “ignores”, then yes: a Bitcoin transaction, like cash, comes with the certainty that a definite quantity of a store of value has changed hands, and little else. How this verifies any “validity” or cuts down on fraud I’m not sure; stolen Bitcoins are spent as easily as stolen cash, which is why <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2013/11/20/more-bitcoins-more-problems-how-hackers-are-targeting-bitcoins.html">theft of Bitcoins has been rampant</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the concern isn’t with fraud or validity. The problem that Bitcoin solves is with the centralized banking model. The fundamental idea behind Bitcoin is that it cannot be centrally controlled or taken down, like the internet. It is impossible to flip a switch and “turn off” the Bitcoin network. It <em>is</em> possible to do that with a centralized bank: in that case, “flipping the switch” ends up being “shut down the bank”. Or, “drive the bank out of business”.</p>
<pre><code>If Bitcoin’s strength comes from decentralization, why pour millions into a single company? Ah, because Coinbase provides an “accessible interface to the Bitcoin protocol”, we’re told. We must centralize to decentralize, you see; such is the perverse logic of capital co-opting power. In order for Bitcoin to grow a thriving ecosystem, it apparently needs a US-based, VC-backed company that has “worked closely with banks and regulators to ensure that the service is safe and compliant”.
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe the problem isn’t with Bitcoin itself, but with what Coinbase is doing with the Bitcoin protocol. Now, to be clear, I think the Bitcoin to USD bridge aspect of Coinbase is OK. But I think that this paragraph is very, very true: it is <em>perverse</em> that we have centralized a decentralized protocol. Decentralized protocols tend to be very dangerous, IMHO, because of the tendency of users to just go with the most popular provider because it’s the easiest solution, and then effectively centralizing the network in the process.</p>
<p>Anyone remember XMPP? XMPP was supposed to be great. It was supposed to be the future of communications on the internet. But in practice, XMPP servers are unreliable. It’s hard to find one that works well. I don’t actually use XMPP a lot myself, but there are a lot of problems with connections, chat requests being undone (so you have to add a contact for a second time), etc. So what happened because of these problems (and the fact that everyone uses Gmail)? The most-used XMPP server is talk.google.com. At least it was, until Google replaced Google Talk with Google Hangouts, which uses a proprietary protocol with no XMPP bridge - and so the network got screwed over, because suddenly, a lot of people upgraded to Hangouts and cut themselves off from the XMPP network. The sad truth, though, is that it almost doesn’t matter. Take a survey of any random Google Talk user. I will bet you $100 that less than 1 out of 50 people who you talk to won’t know that Google Talk is based on XMPP, much less what XMPP is. And there’s almost zero chance that they understand why XMPP matters, or why federated protocols and networks matter.</p>
<p>I’m getting off track, though. So back to Bitcoin and Coinbase. I think what Coinbase is doing by hosting people’s Bitcoin wallets and transactions is fundamentally <em>wrong</em>, because I truly believe that it damages the Bitcoin ecosystem. The centralization in Coinbase is, IMHO, a major problem.</p>
<p>I wonder if this will be solved with a project like <a href="https://arkos.io/">arkOS</a>. I mean, maybe the solutionv that will ultimately happen is for people to spin up their own instances of a Coinbase-like Bitcoin wallet. I think it’s pretty clear that people, in general, like cloud apps better than desktop apps. Access from any computer is a really nice feature to have. Maybe projects like arkOS will help decentralized protocols like Bitcoin remain decentralized in practice.</p>
<p>Or maybe Bitcoin will effectively die, just like XMPP did. I mean, sure, XMPP is still a network. But no one really uses it consciously. Almost everyone who uses XMPP nowadays does so accidentally, through a service that just happens to have an XMPP bridge. Google Talk was a prime example of this, but it’s dead. Now, I’ll bet money that the most-used XMPP provider is Facebook. Never knew that Facebook Chat had an XMPP bridge? That’s because Facebook doesn’t advertise it; the only time it’s mentioned is in the developer docs. The mainstream does not care about the XMPP protocol, because we centralized it. What the mainstream <em>does</em> care about is the services that we centralized it on: Google and Facebook. And that’s a real problem.</p>

            <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a class="p-author h-card" href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author">AJ Jordan</a> on 
              <time datetime="2015-11-08T20:17:38-08:00"><a href="/blog/2015/11/">November</a> 8, <a href="/blog/2015/">2015</a></time> in <a class="p-category" href="/blog/category/development/">development</a> and <a class="p-category" href="/blog/category/musings/">musings</a>
            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>The other day I described programming to someone. I pointed out that it's actually pretty easy to teach yourself programming languages, especially since after a while you start to carry over concepts from other languages. But what surprised me most about <em>my own explanation</em>(!) was when I compared programming to art: it's the kind of thing where you can just try stuff out and see what works and what doesn't, with no real consequences.</p>
<p>Since I said that, I've actually been thinking about it quite a bit. Programming is traditionally described as an activity closely related to mathematics, and to a certain extent, this makes a lot of sense, because of the logical skills that go into programming. You have to be able to reason your way through situations in order to effectively debug a program, which means logically eliminating possible points of failure. This is where math skills become very important.</p>
<p>But coding isn't just about logic. At <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">OSBRIDGE</a> this year, I attended a session about the beauty of code - it's hard to describe to someone who doesn't live and breathe code, but we all know it when we see it. We as a community value elegance in code; clever algorithms; thinking outside the box, and as I said in my <a href="https://strugee.net/presentation-just-do-it/#19">Just Do It slides</a>, the mere existance of Ruby proves this. So when I described programming as being like art, part of where I was getting that is the analogy I actually said (being able to easily mess around), but part of it was coming from my appreciation of the beauty of code. Part of it was coming from my sense of the aesthetic properties of programming.</p>
<p>I want us, as a community, in both our regular coding but also our educational outreach, to stop pretending that programming is so logical that it <em>is</em> math. Yes, there are elements of mathematics in coding. Lots of it, even. But to treat programming as a branch of mathematics is doing a disservice to the practice. So in addition to treating programming as a form of math, I want us to start treating programming as a form of art. There <em>is</em> such a thing as ugly code. The entire concept of refactoring would barely exist if that wasn't true. So let's start truly appreciating the aesthetic beauty of code, and let's start teaching that. To be honest, I'm not sure how you would teach that. But it couldn't hurt to try.</p>
<p>But even if we can and should treat it as both of those things, that doesn't mean that we should make that the be-all-end-all of how we describe programming. I truly believe that programming is not a branch of mathematics. And it's not an art form, either. Programming is neither of those things and both of those things; it is something entirely new, and we should treat it as such. If this isn't true, why do people swear by certain software? Why do people (including myself) aggressively sticker their laptops to showcase what software they use? And if this isn't true, how is it possible that people <em>love</em> their code?</p>

            <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a class="p-author h-card" href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author">AJ Jordan</a> on 
              <time datetime="2015-09-04T16:34:29-08:00"><a href="/blog/2015/09/">September</a> 4, <a href="/blog/2015/">2015</a></time> in <a class="p-category" href="/blog/category/sysadmin/">sysadmin</a> and <a class="p-category" href="/blog/category/tor/">tor</a>
            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>(Okay, so I <em>miserably</em> failed my blog-every-day thing. Shut up. Maybe next time I'll try every week or something... anyway.)</p>
<p>A couple of days ago I logged into the <a href="https://atlas.torproject.org/#details/710E9E3A0A443E3FD33D2801298042783CAD2EAE">Tor relay I run</a> to show someone the ARM graphs. I had a fair amount of traffic, so the graphs were fairly impressive, but I'm also in the habit of running <code>apt-get update; apt-get upgrade</code> every time I log into a server, so I did that too. To my surprise, I got a message telling me that there was a dependency problem with my kernel! So like the great sysadmin I am, I looked at such a fundamental system problem, shrugged my shoulders, and said, "oh, I should probably fix that". And then logged out.</p>
<p>Well, I did end up fixing it today. And boy, was it an adventure. My first step was to ignore the APT problems and edit my <code>torrc</code>, to reflect a) the fact that I'm not eligible for the AWS Free Tier anymore (so I needed to throttle bandwidth), b) my new email, and c) my new GPG key. With that being done, I knew that I could easily have the system fix dependency problems by doing a simple <code>apt-get install -f</code>. Easy!</p>
<p>Well, no. That tried to install some Linux kernel headers, which seemed all well and good, until I got this:</p>
<pre><code>Unpacking linux-headers-3.2.0-90 (from .../linux-headers-3.2.0-90_3.2.0-90.128_all.deb) ...
dpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/linux-headers-3.2.0-90_3.2.0-90.128_all.deb (--unpack):
unable to create `/usr/src/linux-headers-3.2.0-90/arch/arm/plat-pxa/include/plat/dma.h.dpkg-new' (while processing `./usr/src/linux-headers-3.2.0-90/arch/arm/plat-pxa/include/plat/dma.h'): No space left on device
No apport report written because the error message indicates a disk full error
dpkg-deb: error: subprocess paste was killed by signal (Broken pipe)
</code></pre>
<p>Um, what? How am I out of free space? Okay, whatever. I knew that there were probably a lot of packages cached in <code>/var/cache/apt/</code>, including old, vulnerable packages that had been replaced by the unattended upgrades system. I did an <code>ls</code>, and found only about five <code>.deb</code> files - something must have been automatically cleaning that directory. I was getting a little worried now, but I nuked the files anyway and reran <code>apt-get install -f</code>. <em>Same thing</em>. Well, okay, maybe I didn't get rid of enough stuff? How much did I need?</p>
<pre><code>$ df -h /
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/xvda1      4.0G  2.2G  1.6G  59% /
</code></pre>
<p>At this point I'm in full-on "something-is-seriously-wrong-and-I-<em>need</em>-to-recover" mode. How was it possible that I had only used 59% of the filesystem, but <code>dpkg</code> was saying my disk was full? A little searching the internet later, I found the culprit:</p>
<pre><code>$ df -i
Filesystem     Inodes  IUsed IFree IUse% Mounted on
/dev/xvda1     262144 257479  4665   99% /
udev            74758    377 74381    1% /dev
tmpfs           76179    259 75920    1% /run
none            76179      3 76176    1% /run/lock
none            76179      1 76178    1% /run/shm
</code></pre>
<p>I hadn't run out of disk space. But I <em>had</em> run out of inodes. (Isn't this supposed to happen to <em>other</em> people?)</p>
<p>I tried removing some stuff via APT, but that refused to do anything due to the dependency problems. My next thought was that there were probably a bunch of old processes running that were essentially holding a bunch of inodes hostage. I couldn't install <code>debian-goodies</code>, so I couldn't use <code>checkrestart</code>, but I improvised by looping over all running services in a for loop, and restarting them.</p>
<p>Still nothing.</p>
<p>I'm not proud of what I did next. But I was backed into a corner, so I did something only <code>dpkg</code> is supposed to do. I ran <code>rm -r</code> on a couple directories in <code>/usr/src</code>. And boy, it was like magic. Suddenly <code>apt-get install -f</code> worked like a charm. It started to upgrade a couple packages, rebuilding some GRUB configuration files... and then came to a screeching halt.</p>
<pre><code>Setting up linux-headers-3.2.0-90-virtual (3.2.0-90.128) ...
dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of linux-headers-virtual:

E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
</code></pre>
<p>Are you kidding?? <em>More</em> errors?</p>
<p>Turns out that APT is essentially the only thing on this system that makes large changes to the filesystem. So the probability that APT would be the program to trigger the inode limit was pretty high. It started an upgrade run, then got interrupted in the middle by the "no space left on device" error, leaving the dependency tree in a state that we in the tech community call "100% totally screwed". (This is the technical term.)</p>
<p>I'll spare you the gory details, but I ended up trying to chase down packages in the Ubuntu archive, running <code>ubuntu-support-status</code> beacuse I was wondering if the packages I was looking for actually <em>weren't in</em> the archive, because they were unsupported, using <code>aptitude</code> instead of <code>apt-get</code> (because <code>aptitude</code>'s dependency resolver tends to be better), etc. Finally the solution turned out to be doing <code>dpkg --install</code> on the exact right <code>.deb</code>s in the exact right order, which finally satisfied APT's dependency woes, allowed <code>apt-get install -f</code> to fix the configuration problems, and allowed the hundreds of packages which had been waiting for an upgrade to <em>finally</em> install. Whew!</p>
<p>Anyway, I need to upgrade the version of Ubuntu the system is on (currently it's 12.04.5 LTS), because Tor is out of date (among other reasons). However, since that will involve taking the system down for a reboot, I wanted to memorialize the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ uptime
00:01:47 up 392 days, 17:15,  1 user,  load average: 0.05, 0.04, 0.05
</code></pre>
<p>Holy moly. This system is bordering on 400 days of uptime. That's over a year of continuous run time! Astonishing.</p>
<p>Wish me luck with this upgrade...</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: inode limits are <em>killer</em>.</p>

              <time datetime="2015-06-14T01:02:27-08:00"><a href="/blog/2015/06/">June</a> 14, <a href="/blog/2015/">2015</a></time> in <a class="p-category" href="/blog/category/personal/">personal</a>
            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><h3>First things first</h3>
<p>This year I am again attempting to blog every day of summer. I've done this sporadically in the past (and never very well), but I'm trying again this year. Maybe this time will be different. (This is actually my fourth day of summer, but I wanted some time off. Whatever.)</p>
<h3>2 lbs of stickers??</h3>
<p>So recently (i.e. within the past year) I've become more active within the local Seattle community. I'm now on the organizing committee for the <a href="https://wiki.openitp.org/events:techno-activism_3rd_mondays:seattle">Seattle chapter of TA3M</a> (Techno Activism, 3rd Mondays), and am actually running another <a href="https://cryptoparty.in/">CryptoParty</a> this coming Monday. Now, within the wider Seattle activism/tech scene, there's this bag of stickers. It used to be owned by a friend of mine named Elcaset, who apparently just took home some leftovers one day and then kept receiving more and more, because people associated him with stickers. Sadly, Elcaset had to move away from the Seattle area. And since we wanted to keep the stickers, someone needed to keep the bag. And so I ended up with a giant, giant bag of stickers.</p>
<p>Me being me, I decided to sort them and separate them, so that they were easier to lay out on a table. Then I separated them by category. And then, just for fun (and since there were so many of them), I decided to weigh them.</p>
<p>The heavyweight champ by far is the <a href="https://fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> bag, with a whopping 8.25 oz of stickers. Yeah, when I said "heavy" "weight", I meant it. Next we have local usergroups (FreeGeek Seattle, TA3M Seattle, Seattle Privacy and one other whose logo I know is local, but I don't recognize) tied with distributions, both at 5.225 oz. Next up is advocacy groups, namely the <a href="https://eff.org/">EFF</a> and the <a href="https://aclu-wa.org/">ACLU of Washington</a>. I'll admit to cheating on this one, since the EFF has some assorted trinkets that aren't actually stickers, but whatever. This bag was 4.5 oz. After advocacy groups is the miscellaneous bag, which has software projects not associated with anything else, activism films, conferences (aka <a href="https://linuxfestnorthwest.org/">LinuxFest Northwest</a>) and political parties (aka the <a href="https://uspirates.org/">Pirate Party</a>). Finally, as we approach the bottom,  the security/anonymity bag had 2.75 oz, followed closely by the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> bag, which had 2.725. Finally, the LibreOffice/document freedom bag had 2 oz of stickers.</p>
<p>What all this is to say is that I now own a <em>lot</em> of stickers. Specifically, I own an astonishing 2 <em>lbs</em>, 1.625 oz of stickers. Seriously. 2 pounds of what is essentially paper. That's almost unbelievable. (I should point out at this point that I got that number from weighing all of them, not by adding up the above figures, so there may be a slight difference.)</p>
<p>Anyway. I guess I'll have plenty of material to hand out at my CryptoParty.</p>
<h3>Other things</h3>
<p>Other things that have happened recently-ish: I'm going to be in Advanced Photography next year, which I'm super excited about! Also, I joined the SAAS dance program, which should be really fun. At first it was a bit inconvenient, because even though I really wanted to be in dance, with Advanced Photography <em>and</em> Intermediate Dance, I didn't have room in the fall for a Study Hall (which I'm going to need because of college apps). So I ended up deciding to only do robotics on the weekends. Not only that, but the dance show is inevitably the same weekend as LFNW, so I was going to miss Game Night and the Saturday sessions and the afterparty. But things worked out, because apparently they had so many people auditioning this year that they split Intermediate Dance into two sections, and I'm in the one that has class in the winter and spring. That means that not only can I take a study hall in the fall, but our dance show will be at a different time of year, so I can go to LinuxFest Northwest, too. Whoo!</p>

            <div class="e-content"><p>I'm back! Sort of. Very sort of.</p>
<p>I've known for a while that I'm going to ditch Blogger. That's a large part of why I delayed posting stuff to my blog for so long: I didn't have blog software that I really wanted to use, but I didn't want to just put more data into Blogger. Eventually, though, I realized that it would take me a while to write software that a) built an actual blog from Markdown and b) worked the way I wanted it to, so I decided that I would just start cranking out posts and write the software to build them later. And then of course there was the week or three that I spent procrastinating on writing... oh well. I'm here now.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's <s>two</s> three AM as I write this, so I should go to sleep soon. I have a lot of stuff I want to write about, so I'll be brief.</p>
<h3>Summer</h3>
<p>I haven't written anything publicly since <a href="http://ramblingsfromalex.blogspot.com/2014/06/reset-net.html">Reset the Net</a>, way back in June. So I should probably cover some of the things I've been doing.</p>
<p>First, I ran a <a href="https://www.cryptoparty.in/">CryptoParty</a>! It was hosted at <a href="http://blackcoffeecoop.com/">Black Coffee</a>'s old location on Pine, and it was absolutely fantastic. We had a small group of people but it was really fun, anyway. The slides are <a href="https://github.com/strugee/cryptoparty-seattle">on GitHub</a> - and speaking of which, I've switched to <a href="https://github.com/markdalgleish/bespoke.js">Bespoke.js</a> for all my presentations. Hell yeah HTML5!</p>
<p>Right after the CryptoParty was over, I actually had the opportunity to drive down to Portland for <a href="http://debconf14.debconf.org/">DebConf '14</a>, which was one of the most fantastic experiences of my entire life. I met a lot of really cool people there, I got my new <a href="https://strugee.net/gpg">key</a> (also generated over the summer) signed by a lot of Debian folks, and I played a lot of evening games (not Werewolf - the other one). One of the coolest parts was the fact that I actually got to meet two of my heros - Linus Torvalds came and did a Q&#x26;A with us (video of it is available <a href="https://youtu.be/1Mg5_gxNXTo">here</a>) and John Sullivan, Executive Director of the FSF, did a BoF-style talk on how we can get to a point where Debian is on the FSF free distribution list. I got a chance to talk to both of them afterwards, which was undoubtedly one of the coolest things that has ever happened to me thus far.</p>
<h3>Robotics</h3>
<p>Yes, the school year started and I'm a junior now. It's rough.</p>
<p>I'm on 5619 this year at robotics (Gabe, our main mentor, actually called me at DebConf to talk about it). I was a little annoyed to not be on 2856 at first, but it's worked out for the best. We're actually doing really well this year, and I'm so proud of the work we've been doing on the robot. It's difficult - it's much more complicated this year than last year, and there's basically no room on the thing. We had to move <em>wires</em> out of the way to make room for our scissor lift to come down properly. Speaking of which, we have a working scissor lift, which has never been accomplished at SAAS before, at least not during a season! So that's awesome.</p>
<p>We had a rough time our second competition, due to a lot of things - the Field Control System lag was bothering our driver, Wilson, so I wrote up something quick to fix it. I went to test it, and as soon as I ran our scissor lift up, one of the bars - which (of course) we made out of wood - snapped. So we had to rush to fix it before we had to go on the field in three matches or something. And because the bar broke, I didn't get to test the new teleop, and when Wilson tried to drive with it on the field, it broke horribly. Luckily we did pretty well in the first competition, and that gave us a nice buffer to make up for our losses the second time. I can't claim that we're doing well, but we're not doing horribly, either. <a href="https://youtu.be/gJzJUveTyyo">Here's a video</a> showcasing the first competition, and <a href="https://youtu.be/bdcG_WOOLwU">here's a second one</a> of the work the club did beforehand to prepare. Please excuse the weird camera angle of me intensely working on the code because of the time crunch of FTC competition.</p>
<h3>Patching Firefox</h3>
<p>Over Thanksgiving break, I wrote my first Firefox patch! There was a bit of the DevTools that was bugging me, so I fixed it, in true free and open source software fasion. Unfortunately I'm having some trouble writing tests for it, and I haven't had time to track down the information that I need, so the patch hasn't made it into the tree yet. Soon, though! It's on my list of things to do during break. You can see everything over in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1106353">bug 1106353</a>.</p>
<h3>Mail</h3>
<p>I've spent hours of work, spread out over a number of months, working on steevie's mail subsystem. And I'm proud to say that as of a couple weeks ago, I'm finally done. I had to buy a block of static IPs for it, which I felt really cool for doing. There's still a lot of work to do - SPF, outbound DKIM signing, better TLS, Roundcube, ManageSieve, antispam, moving to LDAP from MySQL... the list goes on and on and on, but the system works. And I'm really proud of it. Anyway, I have a new email now: <a href="mailto:alex@strugee.net">alex@strugee.net</a>. I've even set up the customary names to forward to me: you can email <a href="mailto:postmaster@strugee.net">postmaster</a> for email trouble, <a href="mailto:webmaster@strugee.net">webmaster</a> for problems with the web server, and even <a href="mailto:hostmaster@strugee.net">hostmaster</a> for general stuff. Or root, if you're APT or cron or somesuch. It'll all reach me.</p>
<h3>Christmas</h3>
<p>It was Christmas yesterday! Merry Christmas, Internet! I got a bunch of books, including The C Programming Language, Second Edition (yes, this is <em>the</em> book that K&#x26;R C is sort of named after), which was <em>very</em> exciting for me. I also got a budget for steevie approved, so now I can buy a bunch of hardware that I need. Hello, RAID 10 array!</p>
<h3>Stratic</h3>
<p>So, finally onto the juicy development part. <a href="https://github.com/strugee/generator-stratic">Stratic</a> is the name of my new pet project. Stratic is the STReaming stATIC site builder. It's like <a href="https://wintersmith.io/">Wintersmith</a>, except that it runs on <a href="http://gulpjs.com">Gulp</a>, which I've fallen in love with over the summer. Because of that, it's a little weird - there'll be some custom components used to support it, but the main body of code is actually... a Yeoman generator.</p>
<p>There hasn't been much activity in the repo because I'm using the <a href="https://github.com/strugee/strugee.github.com">strugee.github.com repository</a>, which still runs strugee.net even though I'm not on GitHub Pages anymore, as a testbed for Stratic. Once I've ironed out all the kinks, then I'll land all my work in the <a href="https://github.com/strugee/generator-stratic">generator-stratic repository</a>.</p>
<p>I'm very tired, and I want to go to bed, but before I do I figure I should explain the format of this post. Yes, this is Stratic format. It's pure Markdown, but with some additional semantics that Stratic will use to build out the blog. I figure that not many people will use &#x3C;h1>s in their posts, so the Markdown equivalent (#) is used to distinguish the actual post text from what is essentially a header. I did something unusual, though, because even though the header is essentially for Stratic - who authored the post and when, what it's called, etc. - I wanted the Markdown to be at least somewhat readable in source form. Therefore, you're actually allowed to put anything you want in the header section. The values are distinguished by double quotation marks. Stratic will figure out what they mean based on their position. The first set of quotation marks contain the title, the second set contains the date, the third set contains the author, and the fourth set contains a comma-separated list of categories that the blog post should go in. The date looks a little weird - it's seconds since the epoch plus an optional UTC offset. It could be made more human-readable, but then you've got to parse stuff and it just turns into a nightmare. So I opted to sacrifice readability for elegance.</p>
<p>So! This is a blog post without a blog. Soon, I'll finish up Stratic and this will no longer remain solely in source form. I'm excited! I've already rewritten strugee.net in Jade, and used the opportunity to refresh <a href="https://strugee.net/services">the services page</a>. Time to get crackin'.</p>
