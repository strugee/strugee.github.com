              <h2 class="p-name">New programming language part I: Handlers</h2></a>
            <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a class="p-author h-card" href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author">AJ Jordan</a> on 
              <time datetime="2017-01-26T10:59:20-05:00"><a href="/blog/2017/01/">January</a> 26, <a href="/blog/2017/">2017</a></time> in <a class="p-category" href="/blog/category/personal/">personal</a> and <a class="p-category" href="/blog/category/security/">security</a>
            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>So my latest project at the <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> is a new programming language, as yet unnamed. Basically this was inspired by my <a href="https://strugee.net/presentation-security-design">security design</a> presentation in which I laid out a couple ways you can improve programs' security designs, like process separation. And it occurred to me: why is this so difficult? Something should be doing this for me. Enter... whatever the hell I end up calling my language.</p>
<p>One of the most important building blocks of the language is something that I'm currently calling a "Handler". A Handler is basically a segregated piece of application code that handles some task or problem domain. For example, a Handler for outgoing DNS requests (syntax subject to change, obviously):</p>
<pre><code>Handler DNS {
    function getAddressFromHostname(hostname) {
        // Very much pseudocode - all function calls here are example OS calls

        sendDnsQuery(hostname);
        while (!haveDnsResult()) {
            sleep(1);
        }
        
        return getDnsResult();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This Handler has one simple method, <code>getAddressFromHostname()</code>. It sends a DNS query, blocks until it has a result, and then returns the result.</p>
<p>What's cool about this Handler is that it will be run in its own process - in other words, each Handler is automatically transformed into a privilege-separated process. However, <code>getAddressFromHostname()</code> can still be called from other, high-level Handlers! The language will do all the data marshalling for you, so from a language perspective it looks like a regular function call even though in practice it's going cross-process.</p>
<p>Now, let's improve our Handler a little bit. It's pretty unfortunate that we can only make one DNS request at a time (since it's blocking), so let's use an event loop.</p>
<pre><code>Handler DNS is eventLoop {
    function getAddressFromHostname(hostname) {
        // Still pseudocode

        return sendDnsQuery(hostname, function(address) {
            return address;
        });
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We specified that the <code>DNS</code> Handler is an event loop, so the language automatically set up a Node-style event loop - we never actually called anything to enter an event loop, it just sort of happened as a construct of the language. Note also the nice async-aware return syntax - the result of <code>sendDnsQuery()</code> is returned to <code>getAddressFromHostname()</code>'s caller, and the result of <code>sendDnsQuery()</code> is specified by the return value of the anonymous function callback.</p>
<p>We can improve correctness even more by specifying that the Handler is not allowed to make syncronous I/O calls at all:</p>
<pre><code>Handler DNS is eventLoop, async {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Handlers let you pick and choose different elements and design choices for different parts of your application. For example, if you had a Handler responsible for processing data, it might make sense to restrict it to being entirely functional:</p>
<pre><code>Handler incomingData is functional {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>In such a Handler, any functions with side effects wouldn't be callable, enforced at compile-time (possibly parse-time, depending on whether I can make it compiled or not given the type system). Perhaps you want to spawn a new sandbox process for each piece of incoming data (OpenSSH does this, for example, when first receiving authentication data from untrusted users):</p>
<pre><code>// The `ephemeral` keyword will probably be something better, but for now...
Handler incomingData is functional, ephemeral {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>If your application requires root - for example, if you were writing an NTP daemon that needed to call <code>setTimeOfDay()</code> - that's also specified at the Handler level:</p>
<pre><code>Handler incomingData is root {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>This should give you some idea of why Handlers are really interesting, even beyond the process separation concept that underlies them. (It's also worth noting that while I've focused mostly on daemons, this can also be used to securely implement e.g. <code>file</code>.) I'm really excited to get these ideas out there so I'll stop for now, but pretty soon I'll write another blog post talking about the type system.</p>

            <div class="e-content"><p>For several years now I've been really interested in technology policy - things like security, privacy and censorship, and especially how those things relate to both mass surveillance and freedom-respecting software. That's why I follow organizations like Fight for the Future and the EFF, and why I e.g. participated in the movement to stop SOPA and PIPA, the internet censorship bills.</p>
<p>But a week or so ago I had a realization: I'm not interested in surveillance law anymore.</p>
<p>It's clear to me that Congress is completely busted. The 113th Congress came <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/29/in-late-spurt-of-activity-congress-avoids-least-productive-title/">very, very close</a> to being the least productive Congress in modern history. Our current Congress isn't particularly good either, although they are (as far as I know) not as bad as the 113th - but they're still not good enough that I'm confident in their ability to actually, you know, pass laws. Even if we <em>could</em> get Congress to pass laws at all, it's unclear whether we could actually get them to pass laws curtailing mass surveillance. Over and over again we see Congress trying to pass misguided laws that weaken encryption, damage the DNS, and do all sorts of other seriously nasty (and hacky!) things - it just doesn't seem very reasonable to me to assume that they'd change their minds and decide to do (what we think is) the right thing[1].</p>
<p>This is why I'm not interested in surveillance law anymore. I find it to be a waste of time. Instead, I've shifted my focus towards systems that are fundamentally designed to resist surveillance and censorship. That's why I advocate for <a href="https://whispersystems.org/">Signal</a> and why I work on <a href="http://pump.io">pump.io</a>: because these are both systems designed from the ground up to, among other things, essentially be unaffected by surveillance law. Who cares if Congress passes a law that says they can surveil pump.io users? Congress saying a bunch of words doesn't change the fact that technically speaking, that's quite hard to do. Certainly it's more difficult than surveilling e.g. Facebook.</p>
<p>As Moxie Marlinspike puts it in <a href="https://youtu.be/xIiklPyS8MU?t=33m54s">this talk</a> on PKI's flaws and an alternative system called Convergence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And, you know, with this legislation that's been coming up recently like COICA and PROTECT IP and this kind of thing, you know - to me the real lesson here isn't whether this passes or not because there's been, you know, some kind of heroic efforts to prevent this legislation from going through. But I think, you know, the thing to take away from this is that they're <em>trying</em>. To pass regulation that messes with this stuff. And maybe one day they'll succeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trying to make Congress do the right thing is, I feel, akin to an endless arms race: they don't seem to be getting the message and it's doubtful that they'll stop in the near- or medium-term future.</p>
<p>A much better solution is this: implement secure-by-default, freedom-respecting, encrypted and/or federated systems, and be done. Forever.</p>
<p> [1]: honestly, I think a big problem with this is that a lot of Congress is old white guys. Emphasis on old. The problem of people in the legal sphere not understanding technology, especially technology relating to security, privacy and encryption, has cropped up before. Consider, for example, the judge who <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/07/01/judge-decides-we-dont-have-any-right-to-privacy/">ruled</a> that a Tor user had "no reasonable expectation of privacy" because he literally could not wrap his head around how Tor worked and what the FBI did.</p>

            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/releases/tag/v1.0.0">Pump.io 1.0.0</a> is officially available! Whoooo!</p>
<p>I just wanted to write up an announcement real quick to celebrate. Here's a sample what's gone into this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Node 4.x support</li>
<li>Lots of security improvements including a better cross-site scripting scrubber and security-related headers that help protect the web UI (most notably, the web UI now declares a Content Security Policy)</li>
<li>Minor improvements to the API to make it (slightly) smarter</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/">LibreJS</a> support</li>
<li>Numerous dependency upgrades, most notably Connect</li>
<li>And of course, tons of minor bugfixes and improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details, see the brand-new <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#100---2016-08-26">change log</a>.</p>
<p>And of course since we're now past 0.x.x releases, we're now officially making a commitment to the community to make only API-compatible changes going forward (or at least, until 2.0.0!).</p>
<p>As this release <em>does</em> improve security and fixes a lot of bugs, node administrators are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible. If you have a global, npm-based install, you can upgrade with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo npm install -g pump.io
</code></pre>
<p>And with a source-based install:</p>
<pre><code>git pull
git checkout v1.0.0
npm install --production
</code></pre>
<p>If you're upgrading from 0.3.0, everything should Just Work(tm). Don't forget to restart your daemon!</p>
<p>One final note - the rumors are true. While we're not doing so <em>yet</em>, we are, in fact, planning to deprecate running under Node.js 0.10 and 0.12 very soon. Also, if you upgrade to Node.js 4.x early, the new, better XSS scrubber will be enabled - <em>however</em>, be aware that pump.io is far less tested under Node.js 4.x and you are likely to run into more bugs than you would under 0.10 or 0.12. This is an unfortunate situation, but sadly there's really nothing to be done about it. :(</p>
<p>Special thanks to Menno Vossen, Laura Arjona, Evan Prodromou, Jan Kusanagi and all the other volunteers who did so many different things to make this release happen. It truly wouldn't have happened without you.</p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>
<p>With &#x3C;3,</p>
<p>AJ</p>
