            <div class="e-content"><p>Last week I published <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2017/02/how-i-passed-2k-github-contributions">How I passed 2k GitHub contributions</a>. This post is, in some ways, the antithesis of that, and it will be very emotional and messy. Here be dragons.</p>
<hr>
<p>Throughout my time at RC I&#x27;ve noticed only one thing is consistently difficult for me: focusing on hard things. Intellectually I love the idea of challenging myself. And I find that when I start to work on things that are new and not easy, it feels good and I tend to keep working on those things, because they&#x27;re interesting. But starting is something that I just don&#x27;t do frequently enough, and so I find that I haven&#x27;t progressed as a programmer nearly as much as I would like to have.</p>
<p>What is productivity?</p>
<p>Merriam-Webster defines it like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the quality or state of being productive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the rate per unit area or per unit volume at which biomass consumable as food by other organisms is made by producers</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>And &#x22;productive&#x22; is defined like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>having the quality or power of producing, especially in abundance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective in bringing about</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a) yielding results, benefits, or profits; b) yielding or devoted to the satisfaction of wants or the creation of utilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to be used in the formation of new words or constructions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>raising mucus or sputum (as from the bronchi)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>By definitions 1-3 I certainly seem to have been productive; I&#x27;ve written a lot of code, much of which is useful. But useful to <em>whom</em>, and for what purpose?</p>
<p>I sometimes feel as if I&#x27;m just generating more and more code without any guiding process, as though I&#x27;m wasting my time even though concretely I&#x27;m getting a <em>lot</em> of things done - driftless even though I&#x27;m churning out work at an extremely high rate. Is this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">imposter syndrome</a>? Or are my worries legitimate?</p>
<p>Maybe a better way to frame this question is to split it in two - am I being productive for myself, and am I being productive for the community - the two things that are currently important to me personally.</p>
<p>I think I am failing at being productive for myself, in some really important ways. I&#x27;m also succeeding in some - for example, I used to wish I had an engine to run my blog, and now I have <a href="https://github.com/straticjs">such an engine</a>. But in others I am failing.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of RC? Why am I here?</p>
<hr>
<p>recurse.com <a href="https://www.recurse.com/about#who-comes-to-the-recurse-center">says this</a> about people who come to RC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Recurse Center is for people who want to become better programmers. We are not startup school nor are we a bootcamp: Our focus is helping people become better programmers, not building prototypes, and we&#x27;re not a training program for web developers.</p>
<p>Because there is no certification or grading, the only reason to come to the Recurse Center is to become a better programmer. As such, you will find kindred spirits and tremendous energy. We look for smart, friendly, self-directed, intellectually curious people who enjoy programming and want to get dramatically better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More directly, <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual">the manual</a> has this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should be here primarily because you want to become a better programmer and spend the majority of your time here programming and doing things directly related to programming.</p>
<p>Well, we could ask you to be respectful of speakers and keep conversations on-topic in the Recurse Center space during the day (i.e. if you want to take a break and chat about your weekend, go grab a coffee).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, as <a href="https://haroldtreen.com">Harold</a> points out, that <a href="https://haroldtreen.com/tech/recurse/2017/01/27/recurse-center-return-statement/">isn&#x27;t necessarily an accurate picture</a> of what RC is about. I think a lot of what it&#x27;s really about is the people who are in the space with you. I&#x27;ve sure had a wonderful time with the people. Does that mean I&#x27;m &#x22;succeeding&#x22;?</p>
<p>Then there&#x27;s the teaching.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/anja-teaching.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a Zulip message where Anja says &#x22;thank you AJ for teaching us so many things. :)&#x22;"></p>
<p>This is referring to the fact that I teach at Security Club every week, plus my volunteering to run a workshop or two for Beginner&#x27;s Club and Web Dev 101.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, I get very, very little out of teaching at RC. Sometimes it helps solidify (or just plain remind me of) the concepts I teach, but this is the exception, not the norm. So in that sense by spending time teaching, I&#x27;m &#x22;failing&#x22; at being productive for myself. But it seems clear to me that people get a lot out of the time I spend, so I seem to be very productive for the community.</p>
<p>Equally importantly I <em>love</em> teaching. I qualified the previous paragraph with &#x22;practically speaking&#x22; because emotionally teaching is something that&#x27;s very beneficial to me. Does that mean I&#x27;m &#x22;succeeding&#x22;? Does it mean I&#x27;m &#x22;failing&#x22; and &#x22;succeeding&#x22; at the same time?</p>
<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know.</p>

<h3>Day 27</h3>
<p>Arrived ~10:35, departed ~0:30, total time at RC 13h55m.</p>
<p>Had a nice discussion about Stratic in my checkin group this morning. After that I went to the Capture The Flag introduction workshop, then spent essentially the entire rest of the day finishing up <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2017/02/from-static-to-stratic-part-1">static to Stratic</a> (which included, in a truly horrifying fashion, me rewriting and force-pushing the demo repository&#x27;s history a good four times or so) so I&#x27;d have a post up for the iron bloggers meeting. Also spent some time fixing some bugs in <a href="https://github.com/straticjs/generator-stratic">generator-stratic</a> and published the beta 2 release with those fixes. Closed out the evening by digging into a remark problem where <code>&#x3C;script&#x3E;</code> tags would be stripped from posts. Ended up just asking on Gitter.</p>
<h3>Day 28</h3>
<p>Arrived ~10:30, departed ~20:40, total time at RC 10h10m.</p>
<p>Continued to investigate the remark problem based on replies received overnight - turns out it was a bug in remark fixed in a release that had gone out the door literally the same day I asked. After that I spent the day upgrading <a href="https://github.com/straticjs/generator-stratic">generator-stratic</a> (which, remember, was originally scaffolded <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2014/12/new-blog-new-site">years ago</a>) to newer and newer releases of <code>yeoman-generator</code> until it used <code>yeoman-generator@latest</code>. Then I spent time adding some basic tests - they&#x27;re kind of just smoketests for now (are the correct files generated, does <code>gulp serve</code> work) but I <a href="https://github.com/straticjs/generator-stratic/issues/11">intend</a> to expand them. Also moved over some issues to the new <a href="https://github.com/straticjs/RFCs">straticjs/RFCs</a> repository and attended Casual Presentations.</p>
<h3>Day 29</h3>
<p>Arrived ~10:50, departed ~20:35, total time at RC 9h45m.</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t do a whole lot codewise today. However, I did teach Unix fundamentals for Beginner Club, which went pretty well - I just spent the entire time in the commandline, demonstrating different commands. We spent a little time talking about shell scripting, but not much. I forgot to cover conditionals, which was dumb since they&#x27;re pretty weird in shell scripting. Spent some time in the afternoon starting a draft of <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2017/02/how-i-passed-2k-github-contributions">How I passed 2k GitHub contributions</a></p>
<p>Watched Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service in the evening.</p>
<h3>Day 30</h3>
<p>Arrived ~10:35, departed ~00:05, total time at RC 13h30m.</p>
<p>Finished and published <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2017/02/how-i-passed-2k-github-contributions">How I passed 2k GitHub contributions</a>. Presented <a href="https://strugee.net/presentation-cryptography-basics">cryptography basics</a> at Security Club, then spent a lot of time fixing miscellaneous items on steevie. In particular ejabberd was apparently configured to use a standalone certificate bundle (instead of symlinking to something in <code>/etc/letsencrypt/live</code>) - this was because ejabberd requires the private key and the full chain to be in the same file. TLS certificate renewal didn&#x27;t properly update this bundle, so XMPP client connections weren&#x27;t working. ZNC was broken in the same way, so I fixed both of those. I also spent some time setting up a system to publish everything custom in <code>/usr/local</code> <a href="https://github.com/strugee/steevie-usr-local">on GitHub</a> so that it&#x27;s public and version-controlled. So that&#x27;s nice.</p>
<h3>Friday</h3>
<p>Arrived ~15:50, departed ~1:00, total time at RC 9h10m. As always, Friday doesn&#x27;t count as a day because RC is technically not in session.</p>
<p>Came in super late (though I woke up earlier). Almost immediately after that I attended an initial meeting about starting an RFC reading group (an idea I floated on Zulip a couple days ago). Spent most of the day poking at IETF things as well as responding to <a href="https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-seen">hubot-seen</a> PR comments. I just got write access! \o/</p>
<p>Closed out the evening by attending Bottle Share Friday, where I had a long discussion with <a href="http://www.aberke.com/">Alex</a> about running my own email server (which spun off into a discussion of how completely terrible and busted email is), followed by a long discussion about whether Apple&#x27;s release schedule for Safari and attitude towards new web features and third-party iOS rendering engines is justifiable.</p>
<h3>Saturday</h3>
<p>Arrived ~11:15, departed ~23:30, total time at RC 12h15m. Saturday doesn&#x27;t count as a day because RC is not in session.</p>
<p>Marathoned Lord of the Rings today. The showing was small and people drifted in and out but most of the time there were a couple people watching, which was fun. The original plan was to watch the director&#x27;s cut versions, watching The Return of the King on Sunday, but we ended up watching the regular versions because you can&#x27;t rent the director&#x27;s cuts off Amazon, and I wasn&#x27;t about to pay $30 for movies that I <em>already own</em> on DVD back home. We probably would&#x27;ve still watched on Sunday, except that I went out to get pizza for dinnr and found out that it was pouring rain (with thunder/lightning and everything). So I decided we&#x27;d watch The Return of the King and wait for the rain to let up, which worked beautifully.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Husseinfarah93">Hussein</a> came in just as I was about to leave and stated that he almost had a heart attack because he sprinted literally from his apartment to Duane Reade, which truthfully was absolutely <em>hilarious</em>. We had some fun wandering around Duane Reade trying to find soap (which I needed to buy) before we both headed home.</p>
<p>(As a side note, my favorite brand of mac &#x27;n&#x27; cheese by far is Annie&#x27;s, which my local supermarket does not carry. But apparently Duane Reade does!? Wat???)</p>
<h3>Executive summary</h3>
<p>This week was weirdly divided - some parts were hyper-productive and some parts were pretty terrible. I certainly got a lot of work done on Stratic, and I taught a lot. But I didn&#x27;t really do a good job of working on stuff that pushed my programming abilities forward.</p>
<p>Total time at RC 68 hours 45 minutes; cumulative time 363 hours 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>Day 23</h3>
<p>Arrived ~10:00, departed ~21:45, total time at RC 11h45m.</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t get a whole lot done today, mostly because we were all welcoming the Spring 1s - I went out to lunch with some of them and participated in Code Dojo in the afternoon (<a href="https://github.com/adityavkk">Aditya</a> and I solved the challenge in <code>bash</code>, which was pretty interesting an also hilarious[1]). However, I did do some maintenance on <a href="https://gplenforced.org">gplenforced.org</a>. I did, however, start a project to display activity in 455 Broadway in realtime which I&#x27;m pretty exited about.</p>
<p> [1]: Aditya asked me &#x22;so can you just cast a string to an integer in <code>bash</code> or...?&#x22; and when I said no he looked at me and asked how in the world we could complete this task - not realizing that the correct question is, of course, &#x22;does <code>bash</code> have a type system?&#x22; The answer to which is no, no it does not.</p>
<h3>Day 24</h3>
<p>Arrived ~14:30, departed ~1:10, total time at RC 10h40m.</p>
<p>Spent most of today working on realtime.recurse.com - I got the basic API working, so you can POST to the server and it&#x27;ll handle expiry properly. Also spent a lot of time blogging for the Iron Blogger meeting (in which I got sentenced to use <code>vim</code> for the week instead of Emacs for not writing a post a couple weeks ago).</p>
<h3>Day 25</h3>
<p>Arrived ~10:30, departed ~19:10, total time at RC 8h40m.</p>
<p>Spent the day catching up on various things, notably putting out a new pump.io beta that backported some regression fixes. In the evening I spent most of my time finishing up a mid-year college application form before videocalling with a friend in college.</p>
<h3>Day 26</h3>
<p>Arrived ~10:35, departed ~1:05, total time at RC 14h30m.</p>
<p>Spent some time working on server stuff today. Other than that though I didn&#x27;t do much of anything.</p>
<h3>Friday</h3>
<p>Arrived ~16:20, departed ~1:45, total time at RC 9h25m. As always, Friday doesn&#x27;t count as a day because RC is technically not in session.</p>
<p>Worked on <a href="https://github.com/straticjs/generator-stratic">generator-stratic</a> today. I fixed some bugs and disabled some functionality that wasn&#x27;t complete (and was non-trivial to complete). Published a beta 0 in the evening.</p>
<h3>Executive summary</h3>
<p>This week was... <em>okay</em> in terms of productivity. It started off relatively good, slipped a fair amount in the middle, and then somewhat came back at the end of the week. I did, however, check off some semi-longstanding issues on my todo list. So that&#x27;s nice.</p>
<p>Total time at RC 55 hours 0 minutes; cumulative time 294 hours 25 minutes.</p>

            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>So the other day I logged into GitHub and saw something crazy:</p>
<p><img src="/images/github-2k-contributions.jpg" alt="Screenshot of my GitHub contribution graph showing 2,054 contributions over the past year"></p>
<p>How in the hell did I end up with that many contributions? Well, I think I know why - it happened because of a couple related, small habits I have. I thought I&#x27;d share them with everyone else as a sort of trivia - maybe you can adopt these habits too! (Although hopefully because you think they&#x27;re good ideas, not because you just want to make yourself look cool on GitHub.)</p>
<h3>Fix typos</h3>
<p>If projects are freedom-respecting, that means that anyone is welcome to contribute if they&#x27;re able to offer something valuable. How many times have you seen a typo in some docs? GitHub makes it super, super easy to fix these (just click the pencil icon in the upper-right of GitHub file views), and they&#x27;re a fantastic way to contribute a little back to projects. Even if you aren&#x27;t reading docs on GitHub, it often doesn&#x27;t take that much time to find where they&#x27;re hosted (which is frequently GitHub anyway). Really good docs will even have a link to their source right on the generated page.</p>
<p>So whenever I see a typo, I send a Pull Request. It&#x27;s become an automatic response to seeing something that needs fixing, and is pretty routine for me nowadays.</p>
<p>Oftentimes there are changes that aren&#x27;t as easy as a typo, but are still super easy to fix. Take <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1634">this Homebrew PR</a> - I authored it on a tablet and it took me under 3 minutes to make the suggested change[1]. That&#x27;s not a lot of effort, and it&#x27;ll help lots of people looking for the Homebrew change log. The next time you find yourself thinking &#x22;it kinda sucks that...&#x22; ask yourself - can I fix this myself? And if you can, go for it! Even if you screw up, I promise most projects will want to help you out instead of making fun of you[2] - as someone who runs several freedom-respecting projects, I know that getting new contributors is very, very valuable and because of that I&#x27;ll do a lot to make contributing a good experience. I would encourage everyone to, as Mike McQuaid puts it in that Homebrew PR, &#x22;be the change you want to see in the world.&#x22;</p>
<p> [1]: of course, that&#x27;s partly because I&#x27;m pretty good at git and grok things like <code>rebase -i</code>. But even if that&#x27;s not you and it would take you longer, it sounds like a great opportunity to improve your git skills to me!</p>
<p> [2]: I feel obligated to point out that not every project is like this - there are some projects that have a terrible culture (*coughcough*Linuxkernel*cough*). Screw them. They&#x27;re not that common in my experience and it&#x27;s their loss, anyway. Don&#x27;t let them deter you from trying to improve things outside of their bubble of suck.</p>
<h3>File issues</h3>
<p>I just talked about making small changes whenever you see something you can improve with a couple minutes&#x27; time. But what if you&#x27;re in a hurry, or it would take longer?</p>
<p>Filing issues is a super easy way to solve this. Get into the habit of filing issues for everything that irks you[3] - you&#x27;re not allowed to say &#x22;such-and-such a project sucks because it&#x27;s buggy!&#x22; when you haven&#x27;t told the developers about the bug you&#x27;re experiencing!</p>
<p>Filing issues also takes very little time and is super helpful to the developer. Probably a lot of the people who read this blog are software developers, so I&#x27;m betting you can understand how great it is to receive an issue that gives you lots of details that you can then use to fix a bug or a design problem. So why not give the gift of issues? Just make sure to search for duplicates! (This accounts for a significant amount of those 2,000 contributions on my GitHub profile. Over the course of my time on GitHub, I&#x27;ve filed 619 issues, 438 of which were on other people&#x27;s projects. Of course, that&#x27;s just on GitHub - I also do this frequently <em>outside</em> of GitHub.)</p>
<p>Again, every time you find yourself saying, &#x22;why doesn&#x27;t it...&#x22; or &#x22;I wish it...&#x22; or &#x22;it&#x27;s so annoying when...&#x22;, let the developer know! You&#x27;ll help them make their project better.</p>
<p>  [3]: this is not to suggest that you file ridiculous issues that don&#x27;t really say anything or just complain. But a focused bug report describing something concrete that&#x27;s problematic is awesome.</p>
<h3>Publish by default</h3>
<p>This is the last and biggest habit I have that I think led to those 2k contributions: I publish everything by default, no matter what. It doesn&#x27;t matter how bad or hacky or ugly I think a software project is, I just publish it. Because honestly, why not?</p>
<p>Keeping projects public doesn&#x27;t get in anyone&#x27;s way. It&#x27;s not like someone will look at your GitHub and be <em>annoyed</em> that you give so much software to the world. And there&#x27;s even a chance that your hacky script may actually be <em>useful</em> to someone. Even if I think a project is &#x22;bad&#x22; I&#x27;ll still publish it because the reality is that no one is going to go around GitHub specifically trying to find people to make fun of.</p>
<p>Publishing projects also gives me incentive to clean them up - write a README, write tests, and keep a change log (if relevant). My standards are higher because I know all my work is all in the open - not because I&#x27;m afraid of other people telling me I&#x27;m doing it wrong, but because I want to create high quality code that has a better chance of being useful to the wider community.</p>
<h3>In summary</h3>
<p>All of these habits are related. The tl;dr is this: engage by default. Get used to being involved instead of shrugging off a problem and moving on. Put your work out there for other people to see. The open source/freedom-respcting software community belongs to everyone - and that means we can all contribute to improving it. We just have to start.</p>

              <h2 class="p-name">From static to Stratic - part 1</h2></a>
            <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author" class="p-author h-card">AJ Jordan</a> on 
              <time datetime="2017-02-20T14:58:53-05:00"><a href="/blog/2017/02/">February</a> 20, <a href="/blog/2017/">2017</a></time> in <a href="/blog/category/development/" class="p-category">development</a> and <a href="/blog/category/stratic/" class="p-category">stratic</a>
            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>So a couple days ago I published <code>generator-stratic@1.0.0-beta.1</code> to npm. Since Stratic is now officially in beta, I thought I&#x27;d write up a guide to converting a regular, static site to a Stratic-powered blog.</p>
<p>Each step in this blog post (part 1 of 2[?]) will take you closer to having a fully-functional blog, but because of Stratic&#x27;s decoupled design, you can work through them at your own pace. Each step will leave you with a functional environment (i.e. nothing will be &#x22;broken&#x22; such that you can&#x27;t work on your website anymore).</p>
<p>You can see the steps in this post in action at <a href="https://github.com/straticjs/static-to-stratic">straticjs/static-to-stratic</a>. Each commit corresponds to a step in this post.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s get started!</p>
<h3>Initial setup</h3>
<p>The site we&#x27;ll be converting is currently pretty simple. It has an <code>index.html</code> and a <code>projects.html</code>. Each of these includes <code>/css/main.css</code> and <code>/js/main.js</code>. Also, they both have a navigation section and a footer that are duplicated across each page. Each time Alyssa P. Hacker - the website&#x27;s owner - makes a change to these (for example to fix the copyright year in the footer), she has to change both HTML files. The best way for her to add a new page will be to copy an existing HTML file and then change it. This is a little unideal.</p>
<p>Alyssa tracks her website on GitHub (in the example repository mentioned above). Here are links for the <a href="https://github.com/straticjs/static-to-stratic/blob/18a7a7da03a2f84f525f0b699a43005067428199/index.html"><code>index.html</code></a> and the <a href="https://github.com/straticjs/static-to-stratic/blob/18a7a7da03a2f84f525f0b699a43005067428199/projects.html"><code>projects.html</code></a> we&#x27;ll be working with.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s a visual of the project layout:</p>
<pre><code>% tree .
.
&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; css
&#x2502;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500; main.css
&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; index.html
&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; js
&#x2502;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500; main.js
&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500; projects.html

2 directories, 4 files
</code></pre>
<p>When Alyssa needs to preview her website, she manually runs <code>http-server .</code>.</p>
<p>Since Alyssa uses GitHub she publishes her website on GitHub Pages, so her website is in the <code>master</code> branch of her git repository. (Here we&#x27;re assuming that the repository is called <code>aphacker.github.io</code> or something, instead of <code>static-to-stratic</code>.)</p>
<p>In addition to adding blog support, we&#x27;ll improve Alyssa&#x27;s website by reducing duplication while still allowing her to publish to GitHub Pages.</p>
<h3>Step 1 - adding gulp</h3>
<p>Before we do anything else, we need to add a build system. Stratic is designed to work with <a href="">gulpjs</a>, so that&#x27;s the one we&#x27;ll be using.</p>
<p>Adding gulp is super easy. First, we need to create a <code>package.json</code>, so we do <code>npm init</code>:</p>
<pre><code>% npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See &#x60;npm help json&#x60; for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use &#x60;npm install &#x3C;pkg&#x3E; --save&#x60; afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Is this ok? (yes) yes
</code></pre>
<p>A couple things to note here: in general, the defaults are fine to accept. We&#x27;ve provided a description and an author, but these are optional since this isn&#x27;t actually going to be published on the npm registry. They&#x27;re just kind of nice to have.</p>
<p>The same goes for the license, which in this case is the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">Affero GPL 3.0 or above</a> - however, as the copyright holder you are of course free to <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">choose whatever license</a> you want. (Or no license, although I&#x27;d discourage you from doing that.)</p>
<p>Once we have a <code>package.json</code>, we can go ahead and install gulp and another module we&#x27;ll need, <code>ecstatic</code>:</p>
<pre><code>% npm install --save-dev gulp ecstatic
</code></pre>
<p>If you haven&#x27;t used gulp previously, you&#x27;ll also need to install <code>gulp-cli</code>:</p>
<pre><code>% npm install -g gulp-cli
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, we&#x27;ll need to move some files around. Now that we have a build system, we can organize our repository however we want instead of putting stuff exactly where we want it in production.</p>
<p>You can do this however you want. The organization that you&#x27;ll find most projects using, though, is to put stuff in a <code>src</code> directory. Let&#x27;s make that right now.</p>
<pre><code>% mkdir src
% git mv *.html src
% git mv css src/styles
% git mv js src/scripts
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, create a file named <code>gulpfile.js</code> and put the following in it:</p>
<pre><code>var gulp = require(&#x27;gulp&#x27;),
    http = require(&#x27;http&#x27;),
    ecstatic = require(&#x27;ecstatic&#x27;);

gulp.task(&#x27;build:html&#x27;, function() {
    gulp.src(&#x27;src/*.html&#x27;)
        .pipe(gulp.dest(&#x27;dist&#x27;));
});

gulp.task(&#x27;build:css&#x27;, function() {
    gulp.src(&#x27;src/styles/*&#x27;)
        .pipe(gulp.dest(&#x27;dist/css&#x27;));
});

gulp.task(&#x27;build:js&#x27;, function() {
    gulp.src(&#x27;src/scripts/*&#x27;)
        .pipe(gulp.dest(&#x27;dist/js&#x27;));
});

gulp.task(&#x27;watch&#x27;, [&#x27;build&#x27;], function() {
    gulp.watch(&#x27;src/*.html&#x27;, [&#x27;build:html&#x27;]);
    gulp.watch(&#x27;src/styles/*&#x27;, [&#x27;build:css&#x27;]);
    gulp.watch(&#x27;src/scripts/*&#x27;, [&#x27;build:js&#x27;]);
});

gulp.task(&#x27;serve&#x27;, [&#x27;watch&#x27;], function() {
        http.createServer(
                ecstatic({ root: __dirname + &#x27;/dist&#x27; })
        ).listen(8080);
});

gulp.task(&#x27;build&#x27;, [&#x27;build:html&#x27;, &#x27;build:css&#x27;, &#x27;build:js&#x27;]);

gulp.task(&#x27;default&#x27;, [&#x27;serve&#x27;]);
</code></pre>
<p>This gives us a pretty good starting point. This gulpfile defines a couple tasks that simply copy source files into <code>dist</code>. The <code>watch</code> task watches for changes and rebuilds when they occur, and the <code>serve</code> task starts up a server, replacing Alyssa&#x27;s usage of <code>http-server</code>. This provides exactly the same workflow as before: Alyssa runs one command and then she can look at her site on <code>localhost:8080</code>. You can use different task names if you want (for example, <code>html</code> instead of <code>build:html</code>, etc.), but these are what <code>generator-stratic</code> gives you.</p>
<p>However, there&#x27;s one problem: Alyssa can&#x27;t deploy her site anymore. If she pushed like this, visitors would have to visit e.g. <code>https://aphacker.github.io/src/projects</code> instead of <code>https://aphacker.github.io/projects</code>! That&#x27;s no good.</p>
<p>In order to rectify this, we&#x27;ll create a new git branch, <code>src</code>. <code>src</code> will contain the source files, and we&#x27;ll put the final, built site in <code>master</code>, which is what&#x27;s served by GitHub Pages. So:</p>
<pre><code>% git checkout -b src
% git push --set-upstream origin src
</code></pre>
<p>Great. Now, we need to add something to put the built files (i.e. the contents of <code>dist</code>) in <code>master</code>. We&#x27;ll use the <code>gh-pages</code> module for this. First install it and a dependency we&#x27;ll need:</p>
<pre><code>% npm install --save-dev gh-pages gulp-util
</code></pre>
<p>Next, make it available in the gulpfile by adding a line at the end of <code>require()</code> statements:</p>
<pre><code>var gulp = require(&#x27;gulp&#x27;),
    http = require(&#x27;http&#x27;),
    ecstatic = require(&#x27;ecstatic&#x27;);
</code></pre>
<p>And finally, add a <code>deploy</code> task somewhere in the gulpfile:</p>
<pre><code>gulp.task(&#x27;deploy&#x27;, [&#x27;build&#x27;], function(done) {
    ghpages.publish(path.join(__dirname, &#x27;dist&#x27;), { logger: gutil.log, branch: &#x27;master&#x27; }, done);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Now whenever Alyssa wants to deploy a new version of her website, she just runs <code>gulp deploy</code> and it&#x27;ll be taken care of for her. (ProTip&#x2122;: change the default branch to <code>src</code> on GitHub. That way visitors and new clones see the source files, not the build files generated by a program.)</p>
<p>The very last thing we need to do is add a <code>.gitignore</code> file since we&#x27;re installing Node modules and have a build directory now. We&#x27;ll just use GitHub&#x27;s, adding a line for <code>dist/</code> at the end:</p>
<pre><code>% curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Node.gitignore &#x3E; .gitignore
% echo &#x22;\ndist/\n&#x22; &#x3E;&#x3E; .gitignore
</code></pre>
<p>Now we&#x27;ve got a functionally equivalent development setup based on gulp. Success!</p>
<h3>Step 2: converting HTML to Pug</h3>
<p>The next step is to convert the HTML to <a href="https://pugjs.org">Pug</a>. Pug (formerly known as Jade) is a language that compiles to HTML. It lets you do useful things like inherit from a common layout as well as looping over JavaScript variables. If you&#x27;re not familiar with Pug, you should go take a look at its syntax now.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this conversion is to get a program to do it for you. <a href="http://html2jade.aaron-powell.com/">Here&#x27;s the one I used</a> way back when; you may be able to find a better one. The generated Pug will be valid but not the prettiest - you may want to wait to clean it up since we&#x27;re going to do some work to reduce the duplication soon.</p>
<p>Once you&#x27;ve got the converted Pug, you should rename the relevant HTML file to have a <code>.pug</code> extention, then replace the contents with the Pug. Do this for each HTML file.</p>
<p>The last step here is to make gulp build the Pug. Install <code>gulp-pug</code>:</p>
<pre><code>% npm install --save-dev gulp-pug
</code></pre>
<p>Then add <code>pug = require(&#x27;gulp-pug&#x27;)</code> to the end of the <code>var</code> declaration at the top of your gulpfile. Finally, change your <code>html</code> task to look like this:</p>
<pre><code>gulp.task(&#x27;build:html&#x27;, function() {
    gulp.src(&#x27;src/*.pug&#x27;)
        .pipe(pug({pretty: true}))
        .pipe(gulp.dest(&#x27;dist&#x27;));
});
</code></pre>
<p>We&#x27;ll also need to fix the <code>watch</code> task so it has:</p>
<pre><code>gulp.watch(&#x27;src/*.pug&#x27;, [&#x27;build:html&#x27;]);
</code></pre>
<p>which will watch Pug files instead of HTML files.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s it! Alyssa&#x27;s site is now building with Pug instead of HTML.</p>
<h3>Step 3: splitting out the layout</h3>
<p>Pug&#x27;s looping and flow control constructs will be very useful to us later on, but we can get some immediate productivity wins by splitting out the site layout so it&#x27;s not duplicated across every Pug file.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s one tricky thing about this: the navigation is mostly the same between pages, but not quite - the page the user is currently on shouldn&#x27;t be a link. We&#x27;ll solve this by using a <code>block</code> directive for each link. That way, we can override just what needs to be changed, while introducing no duplication.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll have to figure out exactly what parts of your personal layout make sense to be split out. In Alyssa&#x27;s case, there are three main things that are mostly or fully duplicated across pages:</p>
<ol>
<li>The navigation bar</li>
<li>The footer</li>
<li>Invisible metadata and script/style includes</li>
</ol>
<p>These are what we&#x27;ll split out. First, we&#x27;ll make a copy of <code>index.pug</code> and put it in <code>src/includes/layout.pug</code>. (Again, you can organize your files however you want - but in projects generated by <code>generator-stratic</code>, utility Pug files go in <code>src/includes</code>.) Next, edit out the page-specific content and replace them with <code>block</code> directives. Finally, edit each navigation bar item so it has its own <code>block</code> directive, leaving the old code as the default for the <code>block</code> directive.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s what this looks like when we do this to Alyssa&#x27;s site:</p>
<pre><code>doctype html
html
  head
    meta(charset=&#x27;UTF-8&#x27;)
    link(href=&#x27;/css/main.css&#x27;, rel=&#x27;stylesheet&#x27;, type=&#x27;text/css&#x27;)
    block head
  body
    block heading
    nav
      ul
        block nav-homepage
          li
            a(href=&#x27;/&#x27;) Homepage
        block nav-projects
          li
            a(href=&#x27;/projects&#x27;) Projects

    block body

    footer
      p &#x26;copy; Copyright 2016 Alyssa P. Hacker.
    script(src=&#x27;/js/main.js&#x27;, type=&#x27;text/javascript&#x27;)
</code></pre>
<p>Note how I&#x27;ve replaced the <code>h1</code> element (the contents of which vary per-page) with <code>block heading</code>, I&#x27;ve added a <code>block head</code> directive so we can specify the title per-page, I&#x27;ve made a <code>block</code> for each navigation link so we can override them if we want to individually (otherwise they&#x27;ll have the default of being a link), and I&#x27;ve added <code>block body</code> for the main content. I&#x27;ve also cleaned out a bunch of the cruft the automatic converter put in there.</p>
<p>Now, we can edit <code>index.pug</code> so that it inherits from <code>layout.pug</code> - we&#x27;ll use the <code>extends</code> keyword for this. Then we just fill in the content we want using block. Here&#x27;s what this looks like after we&#x27;re finished with Alyssa&#x27;s site:</p>
<pre><code>extends includes/layout.pug

block head
  title Alyssa P. Hacker&#x27;s homepage

block heading
  h1 Alyssa P. Hacker&#x27;s homepage

block nav-homepage
  li Homepage

block body
  p This is the homepage of Alyssa P. Hacker. You can check out the projects I&#x27;ve worked on #[a(href=&#x27;/projects&#x27;) here].
</code></pre>
<p>You&#x27;ll note that I&#x27;ve cleaned out some cruft here, too. We have one last thing to fix: if we change the layout, nothing will get rebuilt. We can fix this by changing the <code>watch</code> task again so that the line for watching Pug files reads:</p>
<pre><code>gulp.watch([&#x27;src/*.pug&#x27;, &#x27;src/includes/*.pug&#x27;], [&#x27;build:html&#x27;]);
</code></pre>
<p>Sweet! <code>index.pug</code> is way shorter than what we had before and includes <em>just</em> the content now. We can do the same thing to <code>projects.pug</code>. Then Alyssa can, for example, correct the copyright year in <code>layout.pug</code> - i.e., once - and that change will go into both <code>index.html</code> <em>and</em> <code>projects.html</code>. I&#x27;ve gone ahead and made the change for her.</p>
<p>To give a high-level overview, here&#x27;s what Alyssa&#x27;s site looks like now:</p>
<pre><code>% tree -I node_modules .
.
&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; dist
&#x2502;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; css

    &#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; includes
    &#x2502;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500; layout.pug
    &#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; index.pug
    &#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; projects.pug
    &#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; scripts

        &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500; main.css

<h3>Next time...</h3>
<p>This post is long enough already, so I&#x27;ll stop here. We&#x27;ve converted Alyssa&#x27;s site to have a really solid base, so next time we&#x27;ll build on top of this work to add superpowered blog features, powered by Stratic.</p>
