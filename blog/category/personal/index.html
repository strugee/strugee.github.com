              <h2 class="p-name">Gender representation at RC</h2></a>
            <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Alex Jordan</a> on <a href="/blog/2017/02/">February</a> 14, <a href="/blog/2017/">2017</a> in <a href="/blog/category/personal/" class="p-category">personal</a>
            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>So I want to talk (real quick) about gender representation in tech. Specifically, the fact that it's abysmal. Women[1] usually account for, at most, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/women-in-tech-the-numbers-dont-add-up/">30% of the employees in a company</a> and that number is often much lower. Even at the companies where it's 30%, that number is misleading because it doesn't adress management positions which are often much lower. (For reference, women accounted for about 59% of the overall workforce as of 2015, when the article I pulled those numbers from was published.) <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/10/02/women-leave-tech-culture/">Here's an article</a> that says that on average, women leave the industry within 7 years of being in it. Let me repeat that, because I didn't say they leave their jobs, or take a break. They completely leave the <em>entire technology industry</em>. And unfortunately it makes sense, since incidents of sexism in tech are <a href="">rampant</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike (most of) the rest of the tech world, the <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> is mostly (completely?) gender-balanced. I want to point out that while for years I've believed in diversity, it didn't become clear to me how much <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/implicit-bias-and-social-justice">implicit bias</a> I held until I joined RC. I find that, having previously spent significant amounts of time in environments that were predominantly white, cis and male, <strong>I find myself needing to self-correct discriminatory and gender-based unconscious assumptions significantly less frequently at RC</strong>. In other words, my subconscious is making less incorrect, gender-based suggestions about what people are like that I then have to consciously reject. I would attribute this almost 100% to the fact that at RC I'm surrounded by lots of people who are a) super talented and know their shit and b) aren't male.</p>
<p>If I have a point to this blog post (and I'm not sure that I do), it'd be to underscore what many have said before me: representation and role models are important. Advocating for gender equality is good and important, but in the end what really matters is what's actually in people's heads. That's mostly influenced by what they see in their immediate lives, and that's why representation is so important - believing in equality is great, but presenting actual evidence to your subconscious that its biases are incorrect is a much more powerful way to improve the way you perceive the world.</p>
<p>If folks have any comments or different perspectives, I'd love to hear them <a href="/contact">privately</a> or via <a href="https://webmention.net/">WebMention</a>.</p>
<p> [1]: I'm focusing on women here because I'm not aware of any statistics about non-binary people in tech. But it's worth noting that it's a huge problem for them, too.</p>

<h3>Day 15</h3>
<p>Arrived ~10:20, departed ~16:30, arrived ~20:00, departed ~23:30, total time at RC 9h40m.</p>
<p>Somehow managed to get up early and arrive at my checkin early, despite being dead-tired (I couldn't get to sleep so I was running on ~5 hours of sleep). Spent most of today working on my HTTPS presentation, but took 30 minutes to an hour or so off to make a couple small improvements to my website - mostly just trimming the projects page and adding information to the contact page about how to communicate securely with me. Left for a while to have dinner with a friend and returned via the subway[1] to work on my HTTPS presentation some more.</p>
<p>(Note 1/31: I felt quite productive today, but in hindsight really didn't get a whole lot done since I was just so tired.)</p>
<p> [1]: which truthfully made me feel unreasonably accomplished since my phone died right as I looked up directions, but I got on the right subway and figured out I could transfer and take a closer line halfway through and eventually made it back anyway</p>
<h3>Day 16</h3>
<p>Arrived ~10:20, departed ~23:10, total time at RC 12h50m.</p>
<p>Spent - no joke - basically all of today working on my HTTPS presentation, which in addition to actually writing the content entailed reminding myself of how things like e.g. TLS False Start actually work. Reminding and/or properly learning (for False Start in particular I had a vague idea of how it worked before, but didn't really understand it).</p>
<p>Took about an hour off in the evening to help repaint a large stretch of wall in the space as part of the cleaning party. Then went back to HTTPS. Highly productive day.</p>
<h3>Day 17</h3>
<p>Arrived ~11:30, departed ~17:40, total time at RC 6h10m.</p>
<p>Caught up with some GitHub stuff in the morning before teaching HTTPS. We went for an hour and a half and <em>still</em> skipped the entire section on TLS performance because HTTPS is complicated and hacky and also <em>really</em> terrible. (As <a href="https://github.com/eeclaire">Claire</a> put it, "I'm now terrified of browsing the web." Me too, Claire. Me too.) I think it went really well, even though it was a little overwhelming for everyone at times.</p>
<p>Spent a bit of time watching YouTube videos on how Diffie-Hellmann works and how Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) works - we'd touched on both of these during the presentation and I needed to put them in Zulip. The one on plain Diffie-Hellmann was just a refresher, but the one on ECDHE was something I'd previously tried to watch <em>several</em> times and had always been too confused. But, this time I got it! Whooo! So that felt awesome.</p>
<p>Left early to go home and sqeeze in some laundry before closing out the evening by going to an RC-organized talk on <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a>.</p>
<h3>Day 18</h3>
<p>Arrived ~10:30, departed ~14:30, total time at RC 4h0m.</p>
<p>Did just a smidge of work on pump.io before going to Abstract Salad Factory, then heading home to catch my flight to Brussels.</p>
<h3>Friday</h3>
<p>Not at RC. Total time at RC 0h0m.</p>
<p>In Brussels for <a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/">FOSDEM</a>.</p>
<h3>Executive summary</h3>
<p>This week had its ups and downs. I was really productive on the HTTPS stuff, but other than that I didn't reeeally get a lot done.</p>
<p>Total time at RC 32 hours 40 minutes; cumulative time 230 hours 45 minutes.</p>

<h3>Day 11</h3>
<p>Arrived ~10:50, departed ~23:20, total time at RC 12h30m.</p>
<p>Arrived 20 minutes late for my checkin, but checked in with <a href="https://stanzheng.com/">Stanley</a> and <a href="https://github.com/heatherbooker">Heather</a> anyway. Started <a href="https://pump.strugee.net/alex/note/q1vco7XwRk6JsYteqTQqPA">an experiment</a> where I turned on <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a>'s "block all unencrypted requests" option, which has been, uh, <em>interesting</em> so far. Spent most of the day working on blog-related things - finishing up and publishing <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2017/01/rc-week-3">RC week 3</a> (which I just straight up forgot to publish on Saturday) along with <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2017/01/surveillance-priorities">Surveillance priorities</a> which I finished exactly two minutes before[1] the start of this week's Iron Blogger challenge meeting. Other than that, poked a little at implementing <a href="https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/issues/1364">OCSP stapling support</a> in <a href="https://www.ejabberd.im/">ejabberd</a>, which is something I want to do for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It'll give me a chance to look at some Erlang, which will be a really interesting experience</li>
<li>It'll give me a chance to try doing something with the OpenSSL API, which is a complete horror show but nonetheless something I would like (some) experience in</li>
<li>I run ejabberd in production and, you know, really want stapling support</li>
</ol>
<p>Ended the night by going to Fat Cat.</p>
<p> [1]: I actually already had a longer post mostly written, but I realized as I was going to finish it that the experiment that I was proposing had a) been done before and b) mostly failed. So I ended up writing "Surveillance priorities" from scratch in a hurry instead.</p>
<h3>Day 12</h3>
<p>Arrived ~10:50, departed ~17:50, total time at RC 7h0m.</p>
<p>Arrived late again, despite leaving a good <em>15 to 20 minutes earlier</em>. Freaking subway. ANYWAY. Checked in on Zulip instead of in person. The day was semi-productive - I worked a little on my operational security presentation for tomorrow, but a lot of my time was spent talking with Rose, discussing the programming language I'm planning to work on/invent. Left early to do laundry at home and then closed out the evening by finishing my presentation as well as finding and reporting a (common and uninteresting) security vulnerability in a web application[2] - unnamed for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>As a side note, as Stanley put it, <a href="https://www.recurse.com/blog/112-how-rc-uses-zulip">I'm RC famous</a>! Kind of, I guess. \o/</p>
<p> [2]: I actually thought I found the same problem in another project, except it turned out that I totally missed something and so instead of being cool I ended up embarrassing myself on GitHub instead. Sadface :(</p>
<h3>Day 13</h3>
<p>Arrived ~10:35, departed ~00:10, total time at RC 13h35m.</p>
<p>Arrived in the middle of my checkin. Spent the morning taking care of some general maintenance tasks, including getting ready to present on operational security, which I did in the afternoon. Spent most of the rest of the day thinking about the design of my programming language and putting it together into a blog post. In the evening, started trying to fix <a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandcats/issues/153">a bug in Sandstorm</a> which was breaking my production install. Also, had my Princeton interview via Skype, which I think went extremely well. Yay! My interviewer was awesome and we had a really interesting conversation.</p>
<p>As a side note, I got to wear my new libuv shirt today, and it is seriously <a href="https://pump.strugee.net/alex/image/zAFejrr9RY6pLFHpSlXBbQ">the coolest shirt I've ever seen</a>.</p>
<h3>Day 14</h3>
<p>Arrived ~10:35, departed ~1:40, total time at RC 15h5m.</p>
<p>Arrived in the middle of my checkin again (still better than earlier in the week, though). It wasn't anything groundbreaking, but it did give me the opportunity to get more hands-on Mercurial experience (and learn a lot about Mercurial's different branching styles). Working in an unfamiliar codebase was also a good experience, as was dealing with Sandstorm's custom UDP protocol. It wasn't really what I meant to do with the day, but also not a total wash.</p>
<p>Attended Thursday presentations followed by Game Night in the evening which was <em>very</em> fun - I played some poker, then lost at chess a bunch of times to Hussein (even when we played Blitz Chess, which he said he was bad at). Then we switched to Go for a while. Finished out the evening by just hanging out with <a href="http://another.workingagenda.com">Fenimore</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Husseinfarah93">Hussein</a>, and <a href="http://kacyjam.es/">James</a>, which was a lot of fun.</p>
<h3>Friday</h3>
<p>Arrived ~15:10, departed ~23:50, total time at RC 8h40m. As always, Friday doesn't count as a day because RC is technically not in session.</p>
<p>Slept in pretty late today. Attended the monthly pump.io meeting immediately upon arrival (sadly Evan wasn't there). Spent the rest of the day responding to PRs - which took a lot of time but didn't actually result in a lot of code - then authoring a Huginn PR to <a href="">add titles</a> to all pages.</p>
<h3>Executive summary</h3>
<p>In a shocking turn of events, this week was relatively productive, but could've been better. I challenged myself a little bit, but I think I can and should do more.</p>
<p>Checkins really helped. Even when I missed the checkin it provided motivation to get up and get moving. 10:30 may be a little too early for me though, so I'm not sure if I'll continue doing it next week.</p>
<p>Total time at RC 56 hours 50 minutes; cumulative time 198 hours 5 minutes.</p>

              <h2 class="p-name">New programming language part I: Handlers</h2></a>
            <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Alex Jordan</a> on <a href="/blog/2017/01/">January</a> 26, <a href="/blog/2017/">2017</a> in <a href="/blog/category/personal/" class="p-category">personal</a>
            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>So my latest project at the <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> is a new programming language, as yet unnamed. Basically this was inspired by my <a href="https://strugee.net/presentation-security-design">security design</a> presentation in which I laid out a couple ways you can improve programs' security designs, like process separation. And it occurred to me: why is this so difficult? Something should be doing this for me. Enter... whatever the hell I end up calling my language.</p>
<p>One of the most important building blocks of the language is something that I'm currently calling a "Handler". A Handler is basically a segregated piece of application code that handles some task or problem domain. For example, a Handler for outgoing DNS requests (syntax subject to change, obviously):</p>
<pre><code>Handler DNS {
    function getAddressFromHostname(hostname) {
        // Very much pseudocode - all function calls here are example OS calls

        sendDnsQuery(hostname);
        while (!haveDnsResult()) {
            sleep(1);
        }
        
        return getDnsResult();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This Handler has one simple method, <code>getAddressFromHostname()</code>. It sends a DNS query, blocks until it has a result, and then returns the result.</p>
<p>What's cool about this Handler is that it will be run in its own process - in other words, each Handler is automatically transformed into a privilege-separated process. However, <code>getAddressFromHostname()</code> can still be called from other, high-level Handlers! The language will do all the data marshalling for you, so from a language perspective it looks like a regular function call even though in practice it's going cross-process.</p>
<p>Now, let's improve our Handler a little bit. It's pretty unfortunate that we can only make one DNS request at a time (since it's blocking), so let's use an event loop.</p>
<pre><code>Handler DNS is eventLoop {
    function getAddressFromHostname(hostname) {
        // Still pseudocode

        return sendDnsQuery(hostname, function(address) {
            return address;
        });
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We specified that the <code>DNS</code> Handler is an event loop, so the language automatically set up a Node-style event loop - we never actually called anything to enter an event loop, it just sort of happened as a construct of the language. Note also the nice async-aware return syntax - the result of <code>sendDnsQuery()</code> is returned to <code>getAddressFromHostname()</code>'s caller, and the result of <code>sendDnsQuery()</code> is specified by the return value of the anonymous function callback.</p>
<p>We can improve correctness even more by specifying that the Handler is not allowed to make syncronous I/O calls at all:</p>
<pre><code>Handler DNS is eventLoop, async {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Handlers let you pick and choose different elements and design choices for different parts of your application. For example, if you had a Handler responsible for processing data, it might make sense to restrict it to being entirely functional:</p>
<pre><code>Handler incomingData is functional {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>In such a Handler, any functions with side effects wouldn't be callable, enforced at compile-time (possibly parse-time, depending on whether I can make it compiled or not given the type system). Perhaps you want to spawn a new sandbox process for each piece of incoming data (OpenSSH does this, for example, when first receiving authentication data from untrusted users):</p>
<pre><code>// The `ephemeral` keyword will probably be something better, but for now...
Handler incomingData is functional, ephemeral {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>If your application requires root - for example, if you were writing an NTP daemon that needed to call <code>setTimeOfDay()</code> - that's also specified at the Handler level:</p>
<pre><code>Handler incomingData is root {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>This should give you some idea of why Handlers are really interesting, even beyond the process separation concept that underlies them. (It's also worth noting that while I've focused mostly on daemons, this can also be used to securely implement e.g. <code>file</code>.) I'm really excited to get these ideas out there so I'll stop for now, but pretty soon I'll write another blog post talking about the type system.</p>

            <div class="e-content"><p>This is week 3 of being at the <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>. </p>
<h3>Monday</h3>
<p>Arrived ~12:50, departed ~00:10, total time at RC 11h20m. Not Day 8 because Martin Luther King Day was today, so RC was not technically in session.</p>
<p>Lazy day today. Participated in an interesting discussion in the <a href="https://conversations.im">Conversations</a> MUC about <a href="https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Easy_Onboarding">Easy XMPP</a> which led to me spending a couple hours working on <a href="https://github.com/ge0rg/easy-xmpp-invitation">this onboarding webpage project</a> (live version <a href="https://yax.im/i/#alex@strugee.net">here</a>). Spent about 5 minutes deploying OCSP Must Staple to <a href="https://nodecompat.com">nodecompat.com</a> and <a href="https://isthefieldcontrolsystemdown.com">isthefieldcontrolsystemdown.com</a> and then about 30 discussing exactly what OCSP Must Staple is with <a href="https://jessewalling.com/">Jesse</a>. Also, submitted a talk on <a href="https://github.com/straticjs/generator-stratic">Stratic</a> to <a href="https://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/">LinuxFest Northwest</a>.</p>
<p>Truthfully I spent a fair amount of my time in #pump.io on Freenode and in particular, got confirmation that <a href="https://e14n.com/evan">Evan</a> will be able to attend this month's pump.io meeting, which is fantastic. Closed out the evening by finishing my last college app and then spending several hours (i.e. waaay longer than I meant to) looking into parts for building an <a href="https://xkcd.com/413/">xkcd-style robot</a> for the space.</p>
<h3>Day 8</h3>
<p>Arrived ~13:10, departed ~23:00, total time at RC 9h50m.</p>
<p>Truthfully, not really sure where today's time went. The biggest real thing I did was fixing a pretty serious <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/issues/1266">regression</a> in pump.io (introduced during the Express 3.x migration) that caused realtime functionality not to work. Plus I wrote the above text (under "Monday") because I didn't have time the previous night. *sigh*</p>
<p>However, I <em>did</em> spend a lot of the evening starting and then finishing my presentation on <a href="https://strugee.net/presentation-webapp-security">webapp security</a> for tomorrow. So that's something.</p>
<h3>Day 9</h3>
<p>Arrived ~13:40, departed ~21:30, total time at RC 7h50m.</p>
<p>Arrived only just in time for my presentation on <a href="https://strugee.net/presentation-webapp-security">webapp security</a> due to a series of unfortunate (mostly subway-related) mishaps. It went really, really well - although we did run for 30 minutes longer than I'd planned, which I was surprised at since last week we only ran a couple minutes over but I had twice as many slides. Covered (mostly SQL) injections, cross-site scripting, password handling, and Cross Site Request Forgery. After that, had an extensive discussion with <a href="https://github.com/ebb-tide">Deniz</a> and <a href="https://github.com/heatherbooker">Heather</a> about security and related subjects (email, selfhosting, the law, and how I think about security systems, mostly) before heading out to Walgreen's to buy some Airbourne, since I think I may be on the verge of getting a bit sick. :(</p>
<p>(Heather and Deniz also suggested I use the word "obviously" less, although it seems like other than that people really like my teaching style. So that feels good.)</p>
<p>The rest of the day was pretty boring: did a <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#211---2017-01-18">patch release</a> for pump.io so that the regression fix that landed yesterday would go out to users. Took care of some system administration maintenance, then did some pump.io issue triaging and some minor fixups in the GitHub repository (notably improvements to the wiki homepage and fixing the Releases page, which was kinda borked).</p>
<p>Finally, since I've been doing a bad (read: <em>terrible</em>) job trying Mercurial so far, I've decided to force myself to use it:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd Development
$ rm -rf icalc
$ # Muck around for a bit because I thought the following would work out-of-the-box, but it didn't
$ hg clone git+ssh://github.com:strugee/icalc.git
</code></pre>
<p>I'll end up using it tomorrow since I'm committing to work on icalc for the entire day. I've been really bad about working on it.</p>
<h3>Day 10</h3>
<p>Arrived ~13:10, departed ~17:45, total time at RC 4h35m.</p>
<p>Arrived riiiight as Abstract Salad Factory was starting. Had a delicious salad and came up with an excellent idea for an RC activity[1] before attending Beginner's Club, which was on testing (and also conveniently in the same room). Spent a little time taking care of business (emails, etc.) before digging into Mercurial by looking at the "Migration from Git" wiki page and just reading links. Feel like I'm on a good track there.</p>
<p>Attended Thursday presentations; came up with a really awesome web standards idea during that that I was <em>extremely</em> excited to propose to the standards community. Looked it up while the jobs fair was getting started - turns out it's <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-mixed-content/#strict-opt-in">already a thing</a>. So that was disappointing. Left for home pretty soon after that.</p>
<p> [1]: one weekend where we take over the main space and marathon through all three extended director's cut Lord of the Rings movies</p>
<h3>Friday</h3>
<p>Arrived ~1:00, departed ~00:50, total time at RC 11h50m. As always, Friday doesn't count as a day because RC is technically not in session.</p>
<p>Spent a lot of time today pairing with <a href="https://github.com/heatherbooker">Heather</a> on improving the <a href="https://github.com/asinghamgoodwin/AbstractSaladFactory">Abstract Salad Factory webapp</a> before devolving into silly shell-related projects like installing <a href="https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck">thefuck</a> and perusing <a href="https://github.com/ayust/underhanded">underhanded</a>, which we actually learned a lot from (because we kept looking up the options and commands the aliases used). Also found out that the version of <a href="">sl</a> packaged in Debian is weirdly old. Like 10 years old.</p>
<p>In the evening, went to Bottle Share Friday which really ended up being "have lots of food and play a game of Codenames but mostly just talk" Friday. Very fun.</p>
<p>Wrapped up the evening with a little bit of Just Dance followed by some <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/pull/1272">pump.io work</a> and more pairing on the Abstract Salad Factory app, which ended with me and Heather wondering if the  version deployed to Heroku didn't actually match the version on GitHub.</p>
<p>Also, signed up for checkins for next week as an accountability tool.</p>
<h3>Executive summary</h3>
<p>Week started out similar to the past week or two - I wasn't terribly good about sticking to RC stuff. However, I brought it back in the end! So I think I'm back on track.</p>
<p>Total time at RC 45 hours 25 minutes; cumulative time 141 hours 15 minutes.</p>
