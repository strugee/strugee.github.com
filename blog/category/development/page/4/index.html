            <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author" class="p-author h-card">AJ Jordan</a> on 
              <time datetime="2017-01-09T19:55:54-05:00"><a href="/blog/2017/01/">January</a> 9, <a href="/blog/2017/">2017</a></time> in <a href="/blog/category/development/" class="p-category">development</a>
            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>So I&#x27;ve been thinking about a new project recently. It&#x27;s called thanksmaintainer.com, and it helps you say, &#x22;thanks, maintainer!&#x22;</p>
<p>Basically this idea came about from <a href="https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/1806">this GitHub thread</a> where some user comes and disparages the Gulp project for being &#x22;not actively developed&#x22; and complains that it&#x27;s taking a long time to release despite the fact that a) Gulp 4 <em>is</em> being actively developed and b) the Gulp maintainers owe this ungrateful, presumptive person <em>nothing</em>. As @contra <a href="https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/1806#issuecomment-247416856">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@rbatllet 4.0 is being worked - if you took more than five seconds to look you&#x27;d see it in other repos (for example: #1604). This repo has almost no code in it, it&#x27;s a wrapper around the other modules so the contribution graph should be completely flat except for doc updates and major releases. We&#x27;ve responded to these tickets so many times - we have lives too.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve had to move across the country 3 times since the tweet you linked - had my business unexpectedly fail (startups!), had relationships fail, deaths, travel, poverty, etc. - where the fuck am I supposed to find time to work on this while I&#x27;m trying to pay rent and put food in my stomach? The attitude people have towards open source authors is disgusting - I don&#x27;t owe you anything, nobody does. Unless you&#x27;ve done something for the open source community (hint: you haven&#x27;t!) then you aren&#x27;t entitled to shit. If you want something to happen then help make it happen, otherwise log off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read this comment and thought, <em>that freaking <strong>sucks</strong></em>. I feel like there&#x27;s a problem in the open source and freedom-respecting software community where consumers demand stuff from project maintainers like the maintainers <em>owe</em> them something or they <em>deserve</em> some feature/bugfix/etc. This is obviously complete and utter bullshit - most maintainers work on their projects in their spare time - and it can start to feel like maintaining a project is a waste of time because all you get from it is a drove of angry entitled haters.</p>
<p>thanksmaintainer.com is designed to solve this problem. Here&#x27;s how you use it; it&#x27;s very simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>You visit thanksmaintainer.com</li>
<li>You sign in with GitHub</li>
<li>You find projects that you use and are grateful for</li>
<li>You click the &#x22;thanks, maintainer!&#x22; button</li>
</ol>
<p>thanksmaintainer.com will keep track of all the good vibes people are sending towards projects. When it reaches a certain threshold, the website will (probably) find a way to contact the maintainers and let them know how many people&#x27;s lives they&#x27;ve made better. Not sure how this last bit will work yet, or if it&#x27;ll even work like that at all. But the core idea is there - hopefully it&#x27;ll be an easy way to give some love back to maintainers who may really need it.</p>
<p>Some design notes: it&#x27;ll only work with GitHub to begin with, but eventually I hope to expand support to e.g. GitLab. Also, the fact that it&#x27;s focused on projects and not maintainers is intentional - being thankful for a person instead of a project isn&#x27;t as meaningful because you&#x27;re not specifying why you&#x27;re thankful. In contrast, the project-centric design lets you say, &#x22;these <em>particular</em> lines of code impacted my life in a meaningful way.&#x22; Plus, a lot of projects have more than one maintainer, and it seems foolish to only thank <em>some</em> of the project maintainers, and not others.</p>
<p>I would love to hear feedback on this idea. So, if you have any thoughts, <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> with me and let me know.</p>
<p>Stay happy &#x3C;3</p>

            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>Greetings!</p>
<p>After a beta period of just over a week, pump.io 2.0.4 is now available on npm and GitHub. Whoohoo!</p>
<p>(This was originally going to be 2.0.0, but we had to do a couple patch releases due to some outdated documentation and several critical bugs. 2.0.4 is mostly the same thing as 2.0.0.)</p>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<p>Note that this release includes security improvements - namely, a newer Express version and a better TLS configuration - and therefore <strong>admins are encouraged to upgrade ASAP</strong>.</p>
<p>For the full list of changes, see <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#204---2016-11-13">the change log</a>.</p>
<h4>Breaking changes</h4>
<p>(As I said in <a href="">the beta announcement</a>:)</p>
<p>Pump.io 2.0.4 is a drop-in replacement for 1.0.0 <strong>unless</strong> you have any plugins configured or you modify the templates.</p>
<p>Plugins are likely to be affected by the upgrade to Express 3.x. The easiest way to migrate is probably to just run pump.io, test out the relevant parts of the app, and see where your plugin crashes. You might also want to look at the <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/master/History.md#300--2012-10-23">Express 3 change log</a>.</p>
<p>If you modified the templates, you&#x27;ll be affected by the templates&#x27; rewrite from utml into Jade. Migration should be relatively painless but has to be done manually. Your best bet will be to save a copy of the diff you created, undo your changes, upgrade, then use the diff you saved to reintroduce your changes. You&#x27;ll have to run <code>npm run build</code> after making changes to Jade files.</p>
<h4>Non-breaking changes</h4>
<p>This release is actually relatively minor in terms of non-breaking changes; however, we <em>do</em> have some nice new improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pump(1) manpage is now included</li>
<li>Any internal web UI link with a <code>data-bypass</code> attribute is now ignored by the routing logic (useful for e.g. custom pages added by the admin)</li>
<li>YouTube links in posts are now shown as  embeds by the web UI (<a href="https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/master/History.md#300--2012-10-23">#1158</a>)</li>
<li>TLS connections now use Mozilla&#x27;s &#x22;intermediate&#x22; cipher suite and forces server cipher suite preferences (<a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/issues/1061">#1061</a>)</li>
<li>Various minor fixes and improvements</li>
</ul>
<h3>Upgrading</h3>
<p>Upgrading is dead-simple. If you used our recommended install method, and installed from npm, you can upgrade with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo npm install -g pump.io@2
</code></pre>
<p>If you installed from source, you can upgrade with:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch
# If you modified templates, save the diff at this step
git checkout .
git checkout v2.0.4
npm install
# Restore your template changes
npm run lint:jade # Optional but recommended if you changed templates
npm run build
</code></pre>
<p>Both of these methods will work whether you&#x27;re running 0.3.0, 1.0.0, or 2.0.0 beta. Make sure to restart pump.io after performing the upgrade.</p>
<h3>Getting help</h3>
<p>If you have any issues with the upgrade, get in touch with <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/wiki/Community">the community</a>. You can also email me at <a href="mailto:alex@strugee.net">alex@strugee.net</a>.</p>

<p>As pump.io is gearing up for our 2.0.0 release, I just published a beta to npm. We&#x27;d love it if any interested admins could upgrade their nodes and report any bugs you may run in to. (All bug reports are helpful, but just so we&#x27;re clear, we&#x27;re likely to only fix regressions from 1.0.0.)</p>

            <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/releases/tag/v1.0.0">Pump.io 1.0.0</a> is officially available! Whoooo!</p>
<p>I just wanted to write up an announcement real quick to celebrate. Here&#x27;s a sample what&#x27;s gone into this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Node 4.x support</li>
<li>Lots of security improvements including a better cross-site scripting scrubber and security-related headers that help protect the web UI (most notably, the web UI now declares a Content Security Policy)</li>
<li>Minor improvements to the API to make it (slightly) smarter</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/">LibreJS</a> support</li>
<li>Numerous dependency upgrades, most notably Connect</li>
<li>And of course, tons of minor bugfixes and improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details, see the brand-new <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#100---2016-08-26">change log</a>.</p>
<p>And of course since we&#x27;re now past 0.x.x releases, we&#x27;re now officially making a commitment to the community to make only API-compatible changes going forward (or at least, until 2.0.0!).</p>
<p>As this release <em>does</em> improve security and fixes a lot of bugs, node administrators are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible. If you have a global, npm-based install, you can upgrade with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo npm install -g pump.io
</code></pre>
<p>And with a source-based install:</p>
<pre><code>git pull
git checkout v1.0.0
npm install --production
</code></pre>
<p>If you&#x27;re upgrading from 0.3.0, everything should Just Work(tm). Don&#x27;t forget to restart your daemon!</p>
<p>One final note - the rumors are true. While we&#x27;re not doing so <em>yet</em>, we are, in fact, planning to deprecate running under Node.js 0.10 and 0.12 very soon. Also, if you upgrade to Node.js 4.x early, the new, better XSS scrubber will be enabled - <em>however</em>, be aware that pump.io is far less tested under Node.js 4.x and you are likely to run into more bugs than you would under 0.10 or 0.12. This is an unfortunate situation, but sadly there&#x27;s really nothing to be done about it. :(</p>
<p>Special thanks to Menno Vossen, Laura Arjona, Evan Prodromou, Jan Kusanagi and all the other volunteers who did so many different things to make this release happen. It truly wouldn&#x27;t have happened without you.</p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>
<p>With &#x3C;3,</p>
<p>AJ</p>
