              <h2 class="p-name">Getting on board with configuration management</h2></a>
            <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author" class="p-author h-card">AJ Jordan</a> on 
              <time datetime="2017-03-28T16:59:56-04:00"><a href="/blog/2017/03/">March</a> 28, <a href="/blog/2017/">2017</a></time> in <a href="/blog/category/development/" class="p-category">development</a> and <a href="/blog/category/sysadmin/" class="p-category">sysadmin</a>
            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>For a long while I've really disliked configuration management. This mostly stemmed from my experience <a href="https://github.com/strugee/steevie/blob/3069f53ee82c6b1709f22285b71ccdc0e5e0bced/apache-config/apache-config.pp">managing Apache via Puppet</a>, which I found indirect and unnecessary - the only reason I did this was basically to get version control. In fact, I even started a project called <a href="https://github.com/strugee/bindslash">bindslash</a> which I literally described as "not configuration management".</p>
<p>However, last Thursday, steevie (my primary server) crashed <em>again</em>. So I went into a fallback DigitalOcean VM I'd set up the last time this had happened and updated stuff. I presented my <a href="https://strugee.net/presentation-pumpio/libreplanet/">LibrePlanet slides</a> from that. And eventually I bit the bullet and set up a secondary email server which, to my great surprise, has not received a flood of spam yet (though I'm sure it will at some point).</p>
<p>The whole ordeal really made me understand the benefit of configuration management. I would've spent less time and been less stressed if I could just plug in a config management system to get a useful failover system. So as of today, I'm on board with configuration management, and bindslash is dead.</p>
<p>I still kinda hate Puppet, so I think I'll try out Ansible and <em>maybe</em> Chef. Ansible's agentless model in particular probably makes a lot of sense for my needs. It also makes me sad to kill bindslash, since I still think it would be a useful project and there's definitely a place for it in the world. But I no longer have any reason to work on it, so I'm just going to stop pretending I'll ever finish it. If anyone is interested in that approach, talk to me and I'll happily give you the name, the repo, my thoughts on its design, etc.</p>
<p>Anyway. Now to set up outbound mail on the failover VM.</p>
<p>*big sigh*</p>

              <h2 class="p-name">Express 4.x in pump.io core</h2></a>
            <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author" class="p-author h-card">AJ Jordan</a> and cross-posted from <a href="http://pump.io/blog/2017/03/express-4.x-in-pump.io-core">here</a> on 
              <time datetime="2017-03-20T16:22:27-04:00"><a href="/blog/2017/03/">March</a> 20, <a href="/blog/2017/">2017</a></time> in <a href="/blog/category/pump.io/" class="p-category">pump.io</a> and <a href="/blog/category/development/" class="p-category">development</a>
            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>So I thought I'd take a moment to announce that the upgrade from Express 2.x to Express 4.x is <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/pull/1208">finally complete</a>! I fixed up the last couple test failures last Wednesday, and the branch got merged on Thursday.</p>
<h2>A long time coming</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, the work to do this upgrade started almost an entire <em>year</em> ago. Express 2.x has been outdated and unmaintained for a long time now, so upgrading has been a high priority. However, it wasn't as simple as adjusting a version number - there were a staggering number of changes that needed to be made due to Express deprecating, removing, and changing things around. One of the most significant problems was the fact that the old template system that we used, utml, was not compatible with Express 3.x and above. That meant that we had to rewrite every single template into a modern language - an effort that resulted in <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/pull/1170">over a thousand lines changed</a>!</p>
<p>However, the time for Express 4.x has finally arrived. With that and some other trivial version bumps, I'm proud to announce that pump.io is fully up-to-date in terms of dependencies with only three, non-critical exceptions. Whooooo!</p>
<h2>Immediate benefits</h2>
<p>There are a lot of reasons this is immediately awesome:</p>
<ol>
<li>Express 4.x fixes significant performance problems that existed in Express 3.x</li>
<li>Relatedly, Express 4.x fixes some security problems present in 3.x</li>
<li>The fact that our dependencies are <em>finally</em> up-to-date means that we can (and do!) now make use of <a href="https://greenkeeper.io/">Greenkeeper</a> and the <a href="https://nodesecurity.io/orgs/pumpio/projects/32213bb8-f9a6-4dd0-8fc6-5caa8ea5f8fc">Node Security Platform</a> to automatically track dependencies to make sure they're up-to-date and not introducing security vulnerabilities</li>
</ol>
<p>That last one is particularly significant. Greenkeeper and NSP will continuously monitor the project's dependencies and automate away a lot of the pain that's associated with keeping pump.io up-to-date. Everyone will get a more secure and stable codebase because of this setup.</p>
<h2>Looking forward</h2>
<p>The Express 4.x upgrade is a big change, and it's definitely possible that stuff has broken. We want to make sure that breakage doesn't make it into production. This change went into pump.io 4.0, which will go through our normal <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/wiki/Release-cycle">release cycle</a>. That means it'll be in beta for a month before being released. As a part of that, <a href="https://jxself.org/">Jason Self</a> - who's kind enough to administer <a href="https://datamost.com/">Datamost</a> - has agreed to have a test day where Datamost upgrades to the beta for a day, then downgrade it again. This test day will give us much wider exposure than we would've gotten otherwise, which will be incredibly valuable feedback in the effort to identify and fix regressions. We haven't set a date yet, but if you'd like to join Jason in helping us find bugs, please get in touch with <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/wiki/Community">the community</a>. We'd love your help.</p>
<p>Beyond the immediate release, though, there's still things to look forward to. Express 4.x gives us a better way to structure routing code, and a refactor to use this structure <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/issues/1232">is planned</a>. There's a lot of room for improvement. But really, the most important benefit is this: technical debt is a far less pressing issue than before. That means that we can shift focus and spend more time fixing user-facing bugs, adding useful features, and generally improving the experience for our users. I couldn't be more excited.</p>

            <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author" class="p-author h-card">AJ Jordan</a> on 
              <time datetime="2017-03-13T15:59:17-05:00"><a href="/blog/2017/03/">March</a> 13, <a href="/blog/2017/">2017</a></time> in <a href="/blog/category/development/" class="p-category">development</a> and <a href="/blog/category/security/" class="p-category">security</a>
            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>So recently I presented on <a href="https://strugee.net/presentation-operational-security/">operational security</a> and then started in on the nightmare that is <a href="https://strugee.net/presentation-https-deployment/">HTTPS deployment</a>. And like I did with <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2017/01/new-programming-language-part-i-handlers">language-level security</a> (I <em>still</em> need to write part 2 of that post), I thought to myself, this is so difficult. Why isn't there something that will do this for me? That's what my latest project is.</p>
<p>Here's the tl;dr:</p>
<pre><code>type(app)
=> Django/Express.js/etc. app
secure_system(app)
=> Docker image
</code></pre>
<p>Or in other words, you'll be able to take an existing web app that you've written, run it through this system, and it will spit out a complete, reasonably-secure system image.</p>
<p>Let's step back.</p>
<h2>The status quo</h2>
<p>Currently, when a developer wants to run a web app, they can either use something like Heroku, which is fully manged, or a VM from DigitalOcean or Amazon EC2 or something. There are a variety of reasons you might not want to use Heroku, but the only other option is a VM - and with a VM, you get a bare system where you have to set up everything from scratch. Lots of developers just don't have the operational experience to do this properly or securely, but it's not like they can go and get an operations team to do it for them. So they end up with systems that may have active security problems as well as little to no defense-in-depth mitigations for when security inevitably fails. Security is just another operational concern the developer has no time and no expertise to deal with, so it just doesn't happen. The developer spins up a VM, gets it to where it "works" and then moves on. <strong>This is not good enough.</strong></p>
<p>I don't want to create a false dichotomy, though: this is not the developer's fault. Everyone has conflicting priorities and it's unreasonable to expect the developer to spend lots of time learning to administrate systems so that they can then spend even more time, you know, administering systems. The problem is that there just isn't enough options available - we have to provide something better.</p>
<h2>A middle ground</h2>
<p>This is what my project is about: creating a middle ground between fully-managed deployment platforms and barebones, setup-from-scratch VMs.</p>
<p>This project rests on the idea that operational security (at least, in a single-server, single-admin context) flows from consistency, least privilege, and proactive, defense-in-depth security measures. Here are a couple core design goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Meet developers where they are. Configuration management like Puppet is a great way to enforce consistency, but it adds a level of indirection and is just another thing that people running hobbyist projects don't have time to learn.</li>
<li>Tight integration with apps - this excludes more obscure types of web applications, but gives us a better footing to set up a solid deployment environment. It also may let us integrate more tightly with things like Content Security Policy in the future.</li>
<li>Support virtual hosting. The ability to run multiple apps while paying for a single VM is a compelling reason people go with VMs over e.g. Heroku - we won't be helping anyone if we leave this out.</li>
<li>Upgrades are optional. Any system image created by this project will present a system that is organized and can be maintained and modified by hand without breaking everything.</li>
<li>Upgrades are possible. Tight app framework integration will aid with putting data into well-known places that can be backed up and migrated to a new image generated by a newer version of this system.</li>
<li>Not designed for "real" production environments. Any project that has a dedicated operations person should not be using this; they should be rolling their own custom environments with something like Puppet. Accordingly, there won't be compromises in security in favor of flexibility - it's designed to cover 75% of cases "pretty well", which is still better than the status quo for smaller projects (almost 100% of cases don't have any security at all).</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd also like to highlight one really important decision: the output is complete system images. Probably at first this will mean Docker containers but this could easily be turned into VM images. This is a critical part of the design because it allows us to make broad, sweeping changes - for example, preferring system components written in memory-safe languages, replacing OpenSSL with LibreSSL, or creating systemd unit files that lock down service runtime environments to reduce the impact of a compromise. These improvements aren't possible unless we control the whole system. And because upgrades are optional but possible, the developer can get security improvements by "just" upgrading a component that they use, in the same way that they'd upgrade a library or something, as opposed to security being a continuous process they have to worry about. Again, obviously not perfect - but much better than the status quo.</p>
<p>I hope to have a MVP out Real Soon Nowâ¢. But in the meantime, if you have thoughts, feel free to reach out.</p>

            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>So the other day I logged into GitHub and saw something crazy:</p>
<p><img src="/images/github-2k-contributions.jpg" alt="Screenshot of my GitHub contribution graph showing 2,054 contributions over the past year"></p>
<p>How in the hell did I end up with that many contributions? Well, I think I know why - it happened because of a couple related, small habits I have. I thought I'd share them with everyone else as a sort of trivia - maybe you can adopt these habits too! (Although hopefully because you think they're good ideas, not because you just want to make yourself look cool on GitHub.)</p>
<h3>Fix typos</h3>
<p>If projects are freedom-respecting, that means that anyone is welcome to contribute if they're able to offer something valuable. How many times have you seen a typo in some docs? GitHub makes it super, super easy to fix these (just click the pencil icon in the upper-right of GitHub file views), and they're a fantastic way to contribute a little back to projects. Even if you aren't reading docs on GitHub, it often doesn't take that much time to find where they're hosted (which is frequently GitHub anyway). Really good docs will even have a link to their source right on the generated page.</p>
<p>So whenever I see a typo, I send a Pull Request. It's become an automatic response to seeing something that needs fixing, and is pretty routine for me nowadays.</p>
<p>Oftentimes there are changes that aren't as easy as a typo, but are still super easy to fix. Take <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1634">this Homebrew PR</a> - I authored it on a tablet and it took me under 3 minutes to make the suggested change[1]. That's not a lot of effort, and it'll help lots of people looking for the Homebrew change log. The next time you find yourself thinking "it kinda sucks that..." ask yourself - can I fix this myself? And if you can, go for it! Even if you screw up, I promise most projects will want to help you out instead of making fun of you[2] - as someone who runs several freedom-respecting projects, I know that getting new contributors is very, very valuable and because of that I'll do a lot to make contributing a good experience. I would encourage everyone to, as Mike McQuaid puts it in that Homebrew PR, "be the change you want to see in the world."</p>
<p> [1]: of course, that's partly because I'm pretty good at git and grok things like <code>rebase -i</code>. But even if that's not you and it would take you longer, it sounds like a great opportunity to improve your git skills to me!</p>
<p> [2]: I feel obligated to point out that not every project is like this - there are some projects that have a terrible culture (*coughcough*Linuxkernel*cough*). Screw them. They're not that common in my experience and it's their loss, anyway. Don't let them deter you from trying to improve things outside of their bubble of suck.</p>
<h3>File issues</h3>
<p>I just talked about making small changes whenever you see something you can improve with a couple minutes' time. But what if you're in a hurry, or it would take longer?</p>
<p>Filing issues is a super easy way to solve this. Get into the habit of filing issues for everything that irks you[3] - you're not allowed to say "such-and-such a project sucks because it's buggy!" when you haven't told the developers about the bug you're experiencing!</p>
<p>Filing issues also takes very little time and is super helpful to the developer. Probably a lot of the people who read this blog are software developers, so I'm betting you can understand how great it is to receive an issue that gives you lots of details that you can then use to fix a bug or a design problem. So why not give the gift of issues? Just make sure to search for duplicates! (This accounts for a significant amount of those 2,000 contributions on my GitHub profile. Over the course of my time on GitHub, I've filed 619 issues, 438 of which were on other people's projects. Of course, that's just on GitHub - I also do this frequently <em>outside</em> of GitHub.)</p>
<p>Again, every time you find yourself saying, "why doesn't it..." or "I wish it..." or "it's so annoying when...", let the developer know! You'll help them make their project better.</p>
<p>  [3]: this is not to suggest that you file ridiculous issues that don't really say anything or just complain. But a focused bug report describing something concrete that's problematic is awesome.</p>
<h3>Publish by default</h3>
<p>This is the last and biggest habit I have that I think led to those 2k contributions: I publish everything by default, no matter what. It doesn't matter how bad or hacky or ugly I think a software project is, I just publish it. Because honestly, why not?</p>
<p>Keeping projects public doesn't get in anyone's way. It's not like someone will look at your GitHub and be <em>annoyed</em> that you give so much software to the world. And there's even a chance that your hacky script may actually be <em>useful</em> to someone. Even if I think a project is "bad" I'll still publish it because the reality is that no one is going to go around GitHub specifically trying to find people to make fun of.</p>
<p>Publishing projects also gives me incentive to clean them up - write a README, write tests, and keep a change log (if relevant). My standards are higher because I know all my work is all in the open - not because I'm afraid of other people telling me I'm doing it wrong, but because I want to create high quality code that has a better chance of being useful to the wider community.</p>
<h3>In summary</h3>
<p>All of these habits are related. The tl;dr is this: engage by default. Get used to being involved instead of shrugging off a problem and moving on. Put your work out there for other people to see. The open source/freedom-respcting software community belongs to everyone - and that means we can all contribute to improving it. We just have to start.</p>

              <h2 class="p-name">From static to Stratic - part 1</h2></a>
            <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author" class="p-author h-card">AJ Jordan</a> on 
              <time datetime="2017-02-20T14:58:53-05:00"><a href="/blog/2017/02/">February</a> 20, <a href="/blog/2017/">2017</a></time> in <a href="/blog/category/development/" class="p-category">development</a> and <a href="/blog/category/stratic/" class="p-category">stratic</a>
            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>So a couple days ago I published <code>generator-stratic@1.0.0-beta.1</code> to npm. Since Stratic is now officially in beta, I thought I'd write up a guide to converting a regular, static site to a Stratic-powered blog.</p>
<p>Each step in this blog post (part 1 of 2[?]) will take you closer to having a fully-functional blog, but because of Stratic's decoupled design, you can work through them at your own pace. Each step will leave you with a functional environment (i.e. nothing will be "broken" such that you can't work on your website anymore).</p>
<p>You can see the steps in this post in action at <a href="https://github.com/straticjs/static-to-stratic">straticjs/static-to-stratic</a>. Each commit corresponds to a step in this post.</p>
<p>Let's get started!</p>
<h3>Initial setup</h3>
<p>The site we'll be converting is currently pretty simple. It has an <code>index.html</code> and a <code>projects.html</code>. Each of these includes <code>/css/main.css</code> and <code>/js/main.js</code>. Also, they both have a navigation section and a footer that are duplicated across each page. Each time Alyssa P. Hacker - the website's owner - makes a change to these (for example to fix the copyright year in the footer), she has to change both HTML files. The best way for her to add a new page will be to copy an existing HTML file and then change it. This is a little unideal.</p>
<p>Alyssa tracks her website on GitHub (in the example repository mentioned above). Here are links for the <a href="https://github.com/straticjs/static-to-stratic/blob/18a7a7da03a2f84f525f0b699a43005067428199/index.html"><code>index.html</code></a> and the <a href="https://github.com/straticjs/static-to-stratic/blob/18a7a7da03a2f84f525f0b699a43005067428199/projects.html"><code>projects.html</code></a> we'll be working with.</p>
<p>Here's a visual of the project layout:</p>
<pre><code>% tree .

<p>When Alyssa needs to preview her website, she manually runs <code>http-server .</code>.</p>
<p>Since Alyssa uses GitHub she publishes her website on GitHub Pages, so her website is in the <code>master</code> branch of her git repository. (Here we're assuming that the repository is called <code>aphacker.github.io</code> or something, instead of <code>static-to-stratic</code>.)</p>
<p>In addition to adding blog support, we'll improve Alyssa's website by reducing duplication while still allowing her to publish to GitHub Pages.</p>
<h3>Step 1 - adding gulp</h3>
<p>Before we do anything else, we need to add a build system. Stratic is designed to work with <a href="">gulpjs</a>, so that's the one we'll be using.</p>
<p>Adding gulp is super easy. First, we need to create a <code>package.json</code>, so we do <code>npm init</code>:</p>
<pre><code>% npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install &#x3C;pkg> --save` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Is this ok? (yes) yes
</code></pre>
<p>A couple things to note here: in general, the defaults are fine to accept. We've provided a description and an author, but these are optional since this isn't actually going to be published on the npm registry. They're just kind of nice to have.</p>
<p>The same goes for the license, which in this case is the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">Affero GPL 3.0 or above</a> - however, as the copyright holder you are of course free to <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">choose whatever license</a> you want. (Or no license, although I'd discourage you from doing that.)</p>
<p>Once we have a <code>package.json</code>, we can go ahead and install gulp and another module we'll need, <code>ecstatic</code>:</p>
<pre><code>% npm install --save-dev gulp ecstatic
</code></pre>
<p>If you haven't used gulp previously, you'll also need to install <code>gulp-cli</code>:</p>
<pre><code>% npm install -g gulp-cli
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, we'll need to move some files around. Now that we have a build system, we can organize our repository however we want instead of putting stuff exactly where we want it in production.</p>
<p>You can do this however you want. The organization that you'll find most projects using, though, is to put stuff in a <code>src</code> directory. Let's make that right now.</p>
<pre><code>% mkdir src
% git mv *.html src
% git mv css src/styles
% git mv js src/scripts
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, create a file named <code>gulpfile.js</code> and put the following in it:</p>
<pre><code>var gulp = require('gulp'),
    http = require('http'),
    ecstatic = require('ecstatic');

gulp.task('build:html', function() {
    gulp.src('src/*.html')
        .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));
});

gulp.task('build:css', function() {
    gulp.src('src/styles/*')
        .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/css'));
});

gulp.task('build:js', function() {
    gulp.src('src/scripts/*')
        .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/js'));
});

gulp.task('watch', ['build'], function() {
    gulp.watch('src/*.html', ['build:html']);
    gulp.watch('src/styles/*', ['build:css']);
    gulp.watch('src/scripts/*', ['build:js']);
});

gulp.task('serve', ['watch'], function() {
        http.createServer(
                ecstatic({ root: __dirname + '/dist' })
        ).listen(8080);
});

gulp.task('build', ['build:html', 'build:css', 'build:js']);

gulp.task('default', ['serve']);
</code></pre>
<p>This gives us a pretty good starting point. This gulpfile defines a couple tasks that simply copy source files into <code>dist</code>. The <code>watch</code> task watches for changes and rebuilds when they occur, and the <code>serve</code> task starts up a server, replacing Alyssa's usage of <code>http-server</code>. This provides exactly the same workflow as before: Alyssa runs one command and then she can look at her site on <code>localhost:8080</code>. You can use different task names if you want (for example, <code>html</code> instead of <code>build:html</code>, etc.), but these are what <code>generator-stratic</code> gives you.</p>
<p>However, there's one problem: Alyssa can't deploy her site anymore. If she pushed like this, visitors would have to visit e.g. <code>https://aphacker.github.io/src/projects</code> instead of <code>https://aphacker.github.io/projects</code>! That's no good.</p>
<p>In order to rectify this, we'll create a new git branch, <code>src</code>. <code>src</code> will contain the source files, and we'll put the final, built site in <code>master</code>, which is what's served by GitHub Pages. So:</p>
<pre><code>% git checkout -b src
% git push --set-upstream origin src
</code></pre>
<p>Great. Now, we need to add something to put the built files (i.e. the contents of <code>dist</code>) in <code>master</code>. We'll use the <code>gh-pages</code> module for this. First install it and a dependency we'll need:</p>
<pre><code>% npm install --save-dev gh-pages gulp-util
</code></pre>
<p>Next, make it available in the gulpfile by adding a line at the end of <code>require()</code> statements:</p>
<pre><code>var gulp = require('gulp'),
    http = require('http'),
    ecstatic = require('ecstatic');
</code></pre>
<p>And finally, add a <code>deploy</code> task somewhere in the gulpfile:</p>
<pre><code>gulp.task('deploy', ['build'], function(done) {
    ghpages.publish(path.join(__dirname, 'dist'), { logger: gutil.log, branch: 'master' }, done);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Now whenever Alyssa wants to deploy a new version of her website, she just runs <code>gulp deploy</code> and it'll be taken care of for her. (ProTipâ¢: change the default branch to <code>src</code> on GitHub. That way visitors and new clones see the source files, not the build files generated by a program.)</p>
<p>The very last thing we need to do is add a <code>.gitignore</code> file since we're installing Node modules and have a build directory now. We'll just use GitHub's, adding a line for <code>dist/</code> at the end:</p>
<pre><code>% curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Node.gitignore > .gitignore
% echo "\ndist/\n" >> .gitignore
</code></pre>
<p>Now we've got a functionally equivalent development setup based on gulp. Success!</p>
<h3>Step 2: converting HTML to Pug</h3>
<p>The next step is to convert the HTML to <a href="https://pugjs.org">Pug</a>. Pug (formerly known as Jade) is a language that compiles to HTML. It lets you do useful things like inherit from a common layout as well as looping over JavaScript variables. If you're not familiar with Pug, you should go take a look at its syntax now.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this conversion is to get a program to do it for you. <a href="http://html2jade.aaron-powell.com/">Here's the one I used</a> way back when; you may be able to find a better one. The generated Pug will be valid but not the prettiest - you may want to wait to clean it up since we're going to do some work to reduce the duplication soon.</p>
<p>Once you've got the converted Pug, you should rename the relevant HTML file to have a <code>.pug</code> extention, then replace the contents with the Pug. Do this for each HTML file.</p>
<p>The last step here is to make gulp build the Pug. Install <code>gulp-pug</code>:</p>
<pre><code>% npm install --save-dev gulp-pug
</code></pre>
<p>Then add <code>pug = require('gulp-pug')</code> to the end of the <code>var</code> declaration at the top of your gulpfile. Finally, change your <code>html</code> task to look like this:</p>
<pre><code>gulp.task('build:html', function() {
    gulp.src('src/*.pug')
        .pipe(pug({pretty: true}))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));
});
</code></pre>
<p>We'll also need to fix the <code>watch</code> task so it has:</p>
<pre><code>gulp.watch('src/*.pug', ['build:html']);
</code></pre>
<p>which will watch Pug files instead of HTML files.</p>
<p>That's it! Alyssa's site is now building with Pug instead of HTML.</p>
<h3>Step 3: splitting out the layout</h3>
<p>Pug's looping and flow control constructs will be very useful to us later on, but we can get some immediate productivity wins by splitting out the site layout so it's not duplicated across every Pug file.</p>
<p>There's one tricky thing about this: the navigation is mostly the same between pages, but not quite - the page the user is currently on shouldn't be a link. We'll solve this by using a <code>block</code> directive for each link. That way, we can override just what needs to be changed, while introducing no duplication.</p>
<p>You'll have to figure out exactly what parts of your personal layout make sense to be split out. In Alyssa's case, there are three main things that are mostly or fully duplicated across pages:</p>
<ol>
<li>The navigation bar</li>
<li>The footer</li>
<li>Invisible metadata and script/style includes</li>
</ol>
<p>These are what we'll split out. First, we'll make a copy of <code>index.pug</code> and put it in <code>src/includes/layout.pug</code>. (Again, you can organize your files however you want - but in projects generated by <code>generator-stratic</code>, utility Pug files go in <code>src/includes</code>.) Next, edit out the page-specific content and replace them with <code>block</code> directives. Finally, edit each navigation bar item so it has its own <code>block</code> directive, leaving the old code as the default for the <code>block</code> directive.</p>
<p>Here's what this looks like when we do this to Alyssa's site:</p>
<pre><code>doctype html
html
  head
    meta(charset='UTF-8')
    link(href='/css/main.css', rel='stylesheet', type='text/css')
    block head
  body
    block heading
    nav
      ul
        block nav-homepage
          li
            a(href='/') Homepage
        block nav-projects
          li
            a(href='/projects') Projects

    block body

    footer
      p &#x26;copy; Copyright 2016 Alyssa P. Hacker.
    script(src='/js/main.js', type='text/javascript')
</code></pre>
<p>Note how I've replaced the <code>h1</code> element (the contents of which vary per-page) with <code>block heading</code>, I've added a <code>block head</code> directive so we can specify the title per-page, I've made a <code>block</code> for each navigation link so we can override them if we want to individually (otherwise they'll have the default of being a link), and I've added <code>block body</code> for the main content. I've also cleaned out a bunch of the cruft the automatic converter put in there.</p>
<p>Now, we can edit <code>index.pug</code> so that it inherits from <code>layout.pug</code> - we'll use the <code>extends</code> keyword for this. Then we just fill in the content we want using block. Here's what this looks like after we're finished with Alyssa's site:</p>
<pre><code>extends includes/layout.pug

block head
  title Alyssa P. Hacker's homepage

block heading
  h1 Alyssa P. Hacker's homepage

block nav-homepage
  li Homepage

block body
  p This is the homepage of Alyssa P. Hacker. You can check out the projects I've worked on #[a(href='/projects') here].
</code></pre>
<p>You'll note that I've cleaned out some cruft here, too. We have one last thing to fix: if we change the layout, nothing will get rebuilt. We can fix this by changing the <code>watch</code> task again so that the line for watching Pug files reads:</p>
<pre><code>gulp.watch(['src/*.pug', 'src/includes/*.pug'], ['build:html']);
</code></pre>
<p>Sweet! <code>index.pug</code> is way shorter than what we had before and includes <em>just</em> the content now. We can do the same thing to <code>projects.pug</code>. Then Alyssa can, for example, correct the copyright year in <code>layout.pug</code> - i.e., once - and that change will go into both <code>index.html</code> <em>and</em> <code>projects.html</code>. I've gone ahead and made the change for her.</p>
<p>To give a high-level overview, here's what Alyssa's site looks like now:</p>
<pre><code>% tree -I node_modules .

<h3>Next time...</h3>
<p>This post is long enough already, so I'll stop here. We've converted Alyssa's site to have a really solid base, so next time we'll build on top of this work to add superpowered blog features, powered by Stratic.</p>
