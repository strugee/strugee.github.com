              <h2 class="p-name">Pump.io 2.0.4 is available</h2></a>
            <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Alex Jordan</a> on <a href="/blog/2016/11/">November</a> 12, <a href="/blog/2016/">2016</a> in <a href="/blog/category/development/" class="p-category">development</a> and <a href="/blog/category/pump.io/" class="p-category">pump.io</a>
            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>Greetings!</p>
<p>After a beta period of just over a week, pump.io 2.0.4 is now available on npm and GitHub. Whoohoo!</p>
<p>(This was originally going to be 2.0.0, but we had to do a couple patch releases due to some outdated documentation and several critical bugs. 2.0.4 is mostly the same thing as 2.0.0.)</p>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<p>Note that this release includes security improvements - namely, a newer Express version and a better TLS configuration - and therefore <strong>admins are encouraged to upgrade ASAP</strong>.</p>
<p>For the full list of changes, see <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#201---2016-11-10">the change log</a>.</p>
<h4>Breaking changes</h4>
<p>(As I said in <a href="">the beta announcement</a>:)</p>
<p>Pump.io 2.0.4 is a drop-in replacement for 1.0.0 <strong>unless</strong> you have any plugins configured or you modify the templates.</p>
<p>Plugins are likely to be affected by the upgrade to Express 3.x. The easiest way to migrate is probably to just run pump.io, test out the relevant parts of the app, and see where your plugin crashes. You might also want to look at the <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/master/History.md#300--2012-10-23">Express 3 change log</a>.</p>
<p>If you modified the templates, you'll be affected by the templates' rewrite from utml into Jade. Migration should be relatively painless but has to be done manually. Your best bet will be to save a copy of the diff you created, undo your changes, upgrade, then use the diff you saved to reintroduce your changes. You'll have to run <code>npm run build</code> after making changes to Jade files.</p>
<h4>Non-breaking changes</h4>
<p>This release is actually relatively minor in terms of non-breaking changes; however, we <em>do</em> have some nice new improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pump(1) manpage is now included</li>
<li>Any internal web UI link with a <code>data-bypass</code> attribute is now ignored by the routing logic (useful for e.g. custom pages added by the admin)</li>
<li>YouTube links in posts are now shown as  embeds by the web UI (<a href="https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/master/History.md#300--2012-10-23">#1158</a>)</li>
<li>TLS connections now use Mozilla's "intermediate" cipher suite and forces server cipher suite preferences (<a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/issues/1061">#1061</a>)</li>
<li>Various minor fixes and improvements</li>
</ul>
<h3>Upgrading</h3>
<p>Upgrading is dead-simple. If you used our recommended install method, and installed from npm, you can upgrade with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo npm install -g pump.io@2
</code></pre>
<p>If you installed from source, you can upgrade with:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch
# If you modified templates, save the diff at this step
git checkout .
git checkout v2.0.4
npm install
# Restore your template changes
npm run lint:jade # Optional but recommended if you changed templates
npm run build
</code></pre>
<p>Both of these methods will work whether you're running 0.3.0, 1.0.0, or 2.0.0 beta. Make sure to restart pump.io after performing the upgrade.</p>
<h3>Getting help</h3>
<p>If you have any issues with the upgrade, get in touch with <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/wiki/Community">the community</a>. You can also email me at <a href="mailto:alex@strugee.net">alex@strugee.net</a>.</p>

            <div class="e-content"><p>Greetings!</p>
<p>As pump.io is gearing up for our 2.0.0 release, I just published a beta to npm. We'd love it if any interested admins could upgrade their nodes and report any bugs you may run in to. (All bug reports are helpful, but just so we're clear, we're likely to only fix regressions from 1.0.0.)</p>

            <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Alex Jordan</a> on <a href="/blog/2016/08/">August</a> 27, <a href="/blog/2016/">2016</a> in <a href="/blog/category/development/" class="p-category">development</a> and <a href="/blog/category/pump.io/" class="p-category">pump.io</a>

<p>I just wanted to write up an announcement real quick to celebrate. Here's a sample what's gone into this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Node 4.x support</li>
<li>Lots of security improvements including a better cross-site scripting scrubber and security-related headers that help protect the web UI (most notably, the web UI now declares a Content Security Policy)</li>
<li>Minor improvements to the API to make it (slightly) smarter</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/">LibreJS</a> support</li>
<li>Numerous dependency upgrades, most notably Connect</li>
<li>And of course, tons of minor bugfixes and improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details, see the brand-new <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#100---2016-08-26">change log</a>.</p>
<p>And of course since we're now past 0.x.x releases, we're now officially making a commitment to the community to make only API-compatible changes going forward (or at least, until 2.0.0!).</p>
<p>As this release <em>does</em> improve security and fixes a lot of bugs, node administrators are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible. If you have a global, npm-based install, you can upgrade with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo npm install -g pump.io
</code></pre>
<p>And with a source-based install:</p>
<pre><code>git pull
git checkout v1.0.0
npm install --production
</code></pre>
<p>If you're upgrading from 0.3.0, everything should Just Work(tm). Don't forget to restart your daemon!</p>
<p>One final note - the rumors are true. While we're not doing so <em>yet</em>, we are, in fact, planning to deprecate running under Node.js 0.10 and 0.12 very soon. Also, if you upgrade to Node.js 4.x early, the new, better XSS scrubber will be enabled - <em>however</em>, be aware that pump.io is far less tested under Node.js 4.x and you are likely to run into more bugs than you would under 0.10 or 0.12. This is an unfortunate situation, but sadly there's really nothing to be done about it. :(</p>
<p>Special thanks to Menno Vossen, Laura Arjona, Evan Prodromou, Jan Kusanagi and all the other volunteers who did so many different things to make this release happen. It truly wouldn't have happened without you.</p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>
<p>With &#x3C;3,</p>
<p>AJ</p>

              <h2 class="p-name">Pump.io: call for testers, call for feedback</h2></a>
            <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Alex Jordan</a> on <a href="/blog/2016/08/">August</a> 10, <a href="/blog/2016/">2016</a> in <a href="/blog/category/development/" class="p-category">development</a> and <a href="/blog/category/pump.io/" class="p-category">pump.io</a>
            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>So in my <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2016/08/new-stuff-in-pump.io">last post</a>, I mentioned that I'd left a couple things for a second blog post. This is that post, and instead of being about all the cool stuff going on in the pumpiverse, it's about stuff that you - yes, <em>you</em>! - can do! It's super easy too.</p>
<h3>Call for testers</h3>
<p>So as I mentioned, the <code>utml-to-jade</code> branch is basically finished (see <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/pull/1170">PR #1170</a>). Since switching templating languages is a huge, huge change, by definition touching every single part of the Web UI, we want to make sure it's well-tested. This is especially critical given the fact that the Web UI unfortunately has <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/issues/147">very little test coverage</a>.</p>
<p>That's where pump.io system administrators come in. If you're a sysadmin and you're willing to test this change on your node, we'd very much appreciate it. There's very little risk, since I <em>think</em> I've squashed all the regressions that happened, but you should be willing to <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/issues">report bugs</a> if you <em>do</em> run into them. In particular, you should look out for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Links that seem to encompass too much text</li>
<li>Missing spaces - e.g. <code>Alex Jordanat [date]</code> instead of <code>Alex Jordan at [date]</code></li>
<li>HTML code showing up on the page - e.g. <code>Test note&#x3C;br /></code> instead of <code>Test note</code> followed by a line break</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the <code>utml-to-jade</code> branch incorporates all changes in the <code>master</code> branch, so you may want to check out the advice in <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/wiki/Running-from-git-master">Running from Git master</a>.</p>
<p>Sound interesting? Want to take part in the development of pump.io? Installing is super easy:</p>
<pre><code>$ [sudo] npm install -g e14n/pump.io#utml-to-jade
</code></pre>
<p>This will work even if you already have a (non-source) install of pump.io - just make sure to restart the server afterwards.</p>
<p>Note that this command has some semi-terrible logic to build Jade templates on install (this is a workaround for a deficiency in npm). If you get a scary warning message from npm, please <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/issues">file an issue</a>, making sure to include the full log.</p>
<h3>Call for design feedback</h3>
<p>The other big thing that's happening is the pump.io 1.0.0 tshirt we're designing! I've spent quite a bit of time working on a variety of candidate designs which can be viewed in <a href="https://cloud.strugee.net/index.php/s/Ymw2RAdxyFZuuwu">this ownCloud share</a>. Obviously we want the coolest tshirt possible, so we're looking for any design feedback that people have. Anyone with some spare time can glance through the designs, and we'd be thrilled to get everyone's opinions.</p>
<p>If this sounds interesting, I'd welcome you to check out <a href="https://cloud.strugee.net/index.php/s/Ymw2RAdxyFZuuwu">the drafts</a>. As always, get in touch with the community through <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/wiki/Community#community-accounts-communication">our chatroom</a> or if you'd prefer, you can email me directly at <a href="mailto:alex@strugee.net">alex@strugee.net</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks so much! :)</p>
