<p>You may wish to skip directly to the <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/#executive-summary">executive summary</a>.</p>
<h1>Resolved goal: Node.js manpage PR</h1>
<p>I didn't <em>complete</em> this goal per se, but I did at least resolve it <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/14164#issuecomment-357909699">by closing the Pull Request</a>. I felt pretty bad about it (especially because I kept saying I intended to finish it) but honestly, it became clear to me that I'd just lost the motivation to keep going with it. I would love it if this was included in Node.js core, but I just consistently have higher priorities. So rather than leave it hanging and cluttering up the Pull Requests view, I just closed it to reflect reality. I made sure not to delete the branch though, in case someone (distant future me?) wants to pick it up again.</p>
<h1>Failed goal: deal with GPG keysigning</h1>
<p>I did nothing to push this goal forward. While I made <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2018/01/improving-gpg-security">numerous improvements to my GPG setup</a>, I did not actually sign anyone's key, which was what this goal was about. This feels unfortunate. (I also do not have access to the private key material in college, and am <em>certainly</em> not about to ask that it be shipped to me.)</p>
<h1>Partially completed goal: push Debian packaging work forward</h1>
<p>There were two components to this: <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/profanity">Profanity packaging</a> upgrades and getting the new <a href="https://github.com/strugee/filter-other-days">filter-other-days</a> packaging into Debian. I made no progress on the Profanity packaging. However, I did <a href="https://github.com/strugee/dots/commit/2b477a7079de9ff675fd4e2d22f58938ffbb7bc9">fix a misconfiguration in my <code>.reportbugrc</code></a> (which annoyingly had previously sent my incredibly detailed email about Profanity packaging to <code>/dev/null</code>) and then submitted <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=886310">an ITP</a> (Intent To Package bug, which is a Debian thing) for filter-other-days. I then used that ITP bug number <a href="https://github.com/strugee/filter-other-days/commit/d09943c6ac4eea07720cc88596bed3594c3f4644">to fix the last <code>.deb</code> Lintian warning</a> (although see below). Then I paired with <a href="https://github.com/anjakefala">Anja</a> who is, as always, an angel, and we figured out the weirdness that is <code>dput</code> and <a href="https://mentors.debian.net/">mentors.debian.net</a>. Finally I was able to upload filter-other-days(!) BUT I was in for a rude awakening - apparently Lintian checks for <code>.deb</code>s and <code>.dsc</code>s are different. So while my binary package was Lintian-clean, my source package unfortunately wasn't. This is something I will need to work on in the weeks to come. That being said, I'm still pretty proud of what I've accomplished here! I've made significant progress on this front.</p>
<h1>Completed goal: lazymention v1</h1>
<p>One of the first things I did was ship lazymention 1.0.0 - and I wrote <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2017/12/announcing-lazymention-elegant-outbound-webmention-for-static-sites">an announcement blog post</a> to accompany it! (In fact, I syndicated that blog post to <a href="https://news.indieweb.org/">IndieNews</a> <em>using lazymention</em>, which felt pretty damn awesome.) I got some great feedback on it from the IndieWeb community, and my <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/kip3yk/announcing_lazymention_elegant">lobste.rs submission</a> - which also got some great engagement - even made the front page, which was pretty unreal! I still have a lot more work to do with lazymention - in particular, it doesn't actually respect edits (so it'll resend Webmentions with every job submission) - but for now it works well. I'm super pleased with it, and have integrated it into my site deployment workflow. I even wrote <a href="https://github.com/strugee/ping-lazymention/">a module</a> so other people can do this, too!</p>
<h1>Failed goals: ActivityPub in pump.io core, pump.io PR review</h1>
<p>No progress on this front. I did start hacking on a <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/telemetry">telemetry server</a> which will eventually be helpful for our ActivityPub rollout, but that did not in any way <em>directly</em> help fulfill these goals. I also <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2018/01/pump.io-5.1-stable-published-to-npm">released 5.1 stable</a>, but that's pretty routine by this point.</p>
<h1>Partially completed goal: two blog posts per week</h1>
<p>I stuck with this goal all the way up until the final week, where I didn't write any. (Although I wrote about my <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2018/01/improving-gpg-security">GPG keys</a> around the time I actually flew back to college.) The first week, I wrote about <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2017/12/shell-script-is-one-of-the-purest-forms-of-human-expression">my thoughts on shell script</a> and about <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2017/12/announcing-lazymention-elegant-outbound-webmention-for-static-sites">lazymention</a>; the second, I wrote about the <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2018/01/pump.io-5.1-stable-published-to-npm">pump.io 5.1 stable release</a> and about <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2018/01/tell-your-pr-reviewers-theyre-wrong">talking to Pull Request reviewers if you think they're wrong</a>.</p>
<h1>Failed stretch goal: paper editing</h1>
<p>I did absolutely no editing on the paper I intend to get published (which I originally wrote for a writing class). This was a stretch goal though, so that's totally fine.</p>
<h1>Additional activity: steevie maintenance</h1>
<p>After I finally found the cable I needed, I swapped out the cable that connects steevie's motherboard with the drives' SATA ports. This seemed to significantly improve disk performance, although there are still noticeable performance problems. I'm very, <em>very</em> happy to have finally gotten this done.</p>
<h1>Additional activity: Tor relay migration from Amazon EC2 to DigitalOcean</h1>
<p>After getting some advice on <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-relays">tor-relays</a>, I <em>finally</em> sat down and looked into moving my relay away from Amazon Web Services. This is because AWS bills by usage, which for a Tor relay ends up being incredibly inefficient. It turned out to actually be way easier than I thought, which only served to make me mad that I hadn't done it sooner. In any case, I now save approximately $240/year AND I can push 1000GB/month as opposed to the 10GB/month I pushed before. In the words of <a href="https://github.com/strugee/torrc/commit/8b9fe85378adc834b8b7a9953de45f508b76bc3e">the commit where I made this change</a>: "this change made possible by the fact that I'm no longer getting billed up the wazoo by Amazon Web Services." Here's a of <a href="https://atlas.torproject.org/#details/C3CFCC9B5993A6F0D1349858C598C4A78AFE51F9">a Tor Metrics graph</a> (captured today) that shows the jump:</p>
<p><img src="/images/tor-relay-graph.svg" alt="Tor Metrics graph"></p>
<p>Anyway, I'm super happy I can contribute more to the Tor network <em>and</em> save lots of money in the process. That being said I am pretty damn salty I didn't realize this in the four <em>years</em> I've been running a Tor relay.</p>
<h1>Additional activity: offandonagain.org maintenance</h1>
<p>After turning on <a href="https://nodesecurity.io/">NodeSecurity</a> monitoring for <a href="https://offandonagain.org">offandonagain.org</a>, I found out that the module that underlies it, <a href="https://github.com/strugee/node-serve-random">node-serve-random</a>, had some vulnerable dependencies. Not only did I fix this, I wrote a large test suite for the module and found (and fixed!) <a href="https://github.com/strugee/node-serve-random/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#200---2018-01-13">several bugs</a> in the process. Writing a test suite also allowed me to turn on <a href="https://greenkeeper.io/">Greenkeeper</a> for the module, which will be a huge help to me in keeping the module up-to-date.</p>
<h1>Additional activity: Stratic work</h1>
<p>First off, I released <a href="https://github.com/straticjs/generator-stratic/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#100-beta-7---2017-12-3">beta 7</a> of <a href="https://github.com/straticjs/generator-stratic">generator-stratic</a>! Nothing major, just some polishing stuff. Stratic is getting very close to the point where I might want to start promoting it more aggressively, or declaring it stable, and (with a <em>lot</em> of super-helpful feedback from my family) I worked on something that's super important before we get there: <a href="https://github.com/straticjs/RFCs/issues/22">a logo</a>!</p>
<p>Here are two of my favorites so far:</p>
<div class="two-image-container">
<p><img src="/images/stratic-logo-asteroid-with-pipe.svg" alt="Yellow background with a centered black file icon and a asteroid coming up from earth in the midddle and a pipe to the right"> <img src="/images/stratic-logo-rocket-with-pipe.svg" alt="Yellow background with a centered black file icon and a rocket coming up from earth in the midddle and a pipe to the right"></p>
</div>
<p>These are based off the JS logo, in case you hadn't seen it before:</p>
<p><img src="/images/js-logo.svg" alt="Black JS text in the bottom-right corner of a yellow background"></p>
<p>Anyway, I have to post another iteration in the <a href="https://github.com/straticjs/RFCs/issues/22">GitHub issue</a> based on some feedback from <a href="http://saul.pw/">Saul</a> (who I had a lovely lunch with) - he thinks I should reverse it so the pipe is on the left, so it looks like the file is coming out of the pipe. But anyway you should comment there if you have feedback!</p>
<h1>Additional activity: IndieWeb stuff</h1>
<p>I attended Homebrew Website Club in San Fransisco, which was <em>incredible</em>. I got to meet a bunch of new people, as well as say hi to <a href="http://snarfed.org/">Ryan</a> and <a href="http://tantek.com/">Tantek</a> again, which was so nice - it's always just <em>better</em> to talk in real life. Tantek said (at least if I recall correctly) that my laptop was one of the best-stickered laptops he'd ever seen, which made me feel just unbelievably special. He also gave me a <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a> sticker (and helped me figure out where to put it), which I had on my old laptop and had been really missing, as well as a <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> sticker. The latter was so special I elected to put it on the inside of my laptop, which I reserve only for <em>really</em> special things (basically a <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> refucktoring sticker and a sticker of <a href="https://github.com/SwartzCr">Noah</a> in <a href="https://www.eff.org/encrypt-the-web">this video</a>, which he handed to me like a business card the first time we met). Anyway, every time I look at the Let's Encrypt sticker I just feel so happy. I love Let's Encrypt so damn much.</p>
<p>Homebrew Website Club was super inspiring, so when I got back to where I was staying (at my mom's boyfriend's house) I started implementing an <a href="https://indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a>-style social stream for strugee.net. It still needs some polishing but is actually pretty close to being done. Who knows when I'll have time to finish it, but it's getting there! I'm so freaking excited, honestly. Also, I added proper timestamp mf2 metadata to my site, as well as a visual display for post edits, and I expanded what type of Webmentions the display code recognizes too!</p>
<!-- TODO nuke this when I actually do proper header anchors -->
<p><span id="executive-summary"></span></p>
<h1>Executive summary</h1>
<p>I resolved or completed 2 goals, partially completed 2 goals, failed 3 goals, and failed 1 stretch goal. Additionally I did significant work in 5 other areas. Out of the goals I set for myself, I completed 51% (Debian packaging work is ~2/5 complete; blog posts were written 2/3 of the time); not counting the stretch goal, I completed 61.2%. I'm pretty happy with what I got done during this period; however, while I was productive, the numbers show that I did a mediocre job sticking to my goals. In the future I should focus on making more realistic goals and then sticking to them (though not too much - it is a break, after all!).</p>
<p>Speaking of which, partway through break I felt like I was on the edge of burnout, which to me was a <em>very</em> clear sign that I was pushing myself way too hard during a time I should have been unwinding. Because of that I cut what I was doing a <em>lot</em>, which helped pretty dramatically. In fact, I think without that I wouldn't have been able to do some of the later stuff, like all the IndieWeb work. So that's another reason I have to find a way to balance sticking to goals and just relaxing (which doesn't necessarily mean not coding, just doing whatever coding I feel like in the moment) - I feel like I was pushing myself too hard to meet my goals (and then getting distracted and not meeting them) and that's what led to the feeling. Obviously there are different constraints for e.g. schoolwork; here I'm referring <em>only</em> to free time like breaks.</p>
<h1>Spring semester goals</h1>
<p>With that in mind, I want to set some very broad goals for spring semester. I may update this list as time goes on, but for now I have four overarching goals I want to accomplish (besides the usual day-to-day code maintenance stuff):</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish editing the paper I wrote last semester on freedom-respecting software and intersectionality, and get it published</li>
<li>Make <em>some</em> measurable progress on my <a href="https://github.com/strugee/draft-webpush-2fa">Push-based Two-factor Authentication IETF draft</a></li>
<li>Get access to the University of Rochester darkroom and start developing/printing photos again</li>
<li>Start pushing the University of Rochester library (and <em>maybe</em> the journalism department?) to start adopting Tor technologies</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm excited to see how it goes!</p>

<h1>Nitrokey</h1>
<p>First, and most importantly, I have recently acquired a <a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/">Nitrokey Storage</a>. After I initialized the internal storage keys (which took a <em>really</em> long time), I used <code>gpg --edit-key</code> to edit my local keyring. I selected my first subkey, since in my day-to-day keyring the master key's private component is stripped, and issued <code>keytocard</code> to move the subkey to the Nitrokey. Then I repeated the process for the other subkey.</p>
<p>In the middle of this I <em>did</em> run into an annoying issue: GPG was giving me errors about not having a pinentry, even though the <code>pinentry-curses</code> and <code>pinentry-gnome3</code> packages were <em>clearly</em> installed. I had been dealing with this issue pretty much since I set up the system, and I had been working around it by issuing <code>echo "test" | gpg2 --pinentry-mode loopback --clearsign &gt; /dev/null</code> every time I wanted to perform a key operation. This worked because I was forcing GPG to not use the system pinentry program and instead just prompt directly on the local TTY; since I had put in the password, <code>gpg-agent</code> would then have the password cached for a while so I could do the key operation without GPG needing to prompt for a password (and thus without the pinentry error). However, this didn't seem to work for <code>--edit-key</code>, which I found supremely annoying.</p>
<p>However this turned out to be a good thing because it forced me to <em>finally</em> deal with the issue. I tried lots of things in an effort to figure out what was going on: I ran <code>dpkg-reconfigure pinentry-gnome3</code>, <code>dpkg-reconfigure gnupg2</code>, and I even manually ran <code>/usr/bin/pinentry</code> to make sure it was working. Turns out that, like many helpful protocols, the pinentry protocol lets you send <code>HELP</code>, and if you do so you'll get back a really nice list of possible commands. I played around with this and was able to get GNOME Shell to prompt me for a password, which was then echoed back to me in the terminal!</p>
<p>Despite feeling cool because of that, I still had the pinentry problem. So finally I just started searching all the GPG manpages for mentions of "pinentry". I looked at <code>gpg(1)</code> first, which was unhelpful, and then I looked at <code>gpgconf(1)</code>. That one was also <em>mostly</em> unhelpful, but the "SEE ALSO" section <em>did</em> make me think to look at <code>gpg-agent(1)</code>, where I hit upon the solution. Turns out <code>gpg-agent(1)</code> has a note about pinentry programs right at the very top, in the "DESCRIPTION" section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please make sure that a proper pinentry program has been installed under the default filename (which is system dependent) or use the option <code>pinentry-program</code> to specify the full name of that program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mention of the <code>pinentry-program</code> option led me pretty immediately to my solution. I had originally copied my <code>.gnupg</code> directory from my old MacBook Pro, and apparently GPGTools - a Mac package that integrated GPG nicely with the environment (as well as providing a GUI I never used) - had added its own <code>pinentry-program</code> line to <code>gpg-agent.conf</code>. That line pointed at a path installed by GPGTools, which of course didn't exist on my new Linux system. As soon as I removed the line, <code>--edit-key</code> worked like a charm. (I've also just added <code>gpg-agent.conf</code> to my <a href="https://github.com/strugee/dots/blob/master/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf">dotfiles</a> so I notice this kind of thing in the future.)</p>
<p>So far, I'm really enjoying my Nitrokey. It works really well and the app is pretty good, although the menu can be pretty glitchy sometimes. I've used the password manager for a couple high-security passwords (mostly bank passwords) which is great, and I've switched my two-factor authentication for GitHub from FreeOTP on my phone to the Nitrokey since GitHub is a super important account and I really want to make sure people can't push code as me.</p>
<p>There are only two problems I've had with the Nitrokey so far. The first is that it's slow. I notice a significant pause when I do any crypto operation, probably somewhere between a half a second to a second. This hits me quite often since I sign all my Git commits; however I suspect I'll get used to this, and the security benefits are well worth the wait anyway. The other problem is that the Nitrokey doesn't support FIDO U2F authentication. This wasn't a surprise (I knew it wouldn't when I was shopping models) but is nevertheless a problem I would like to deal with (which means getting a second device). The basic reason is just that U2F is newer than the Nitrokey I have. Other than those, though, I would highly recommend Nitrokey. The device is durable, too - I just carry it around in my pocket. (I briefly considered putting it on my keychain - for those of you who haven't met me in person, I have my keychain on an easily-detachable connector attached to a belt loop - but I decided against it because my keychain is kinda hefty.)</p>
<h1>Keybase</h1>
<p>In addition to the Nitrokey, I've also finally started using <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase</a>!</p>
<p>For a long time I wasn't too sure about Keybase. I felt like people should really be meeting in person and doing keysigning parties, and I didn't like that they encourage you to upload a private key to them, even if it's password-protected. Eventually I softened my position a little bit and got an invite from <a href="https://keybase.io/yawnbox">Christopher Sheats</a> (back then you needed an invite) but I only made it halfway through the install process before getting distracted and forgetting about it for, you know, several years.</p>
<p>This time, though, I decided to finally get my act together. Do I still kinda think it's a bummer that Keybase encourages private key uploads? Sure. Are real-life keysignings better? <em>Absolutely</em>. But even though they're better, a lot of experience trying to do them and teach them has thoroughly convinced me that they're just too impractical. There are lots of people who might need to at least have <em>some</em> trust in my key - for example, to verify software signatures - and this is a pretty decent solution for them. Not to mention a novel and interesting solution. Plus, it's possible to use Keybase in such a way that you're not compromising security in any way, which is the way I do it.</p>
<p>So tl;dr: I'm on the Keybase bandwagon now. <a href="https://keybase.io/strugee">My profile</a> is also now linked to from my <a href="https://strugee.net/gpg">GPG keys</a> page.</p>
<h1>Safe for master key</h1>
<p>Finally, my dad's wife's safe has recently been moved into our house and is conveniently sitting next to my computer. Currently, I keep my master key in a file on a flash drive with an encrypted LUKS container. When I need to access my master key, this file gets unlocked with <code>cryptsetup</code> and then mounted somewhere on my laptop, and I pass the <code>--homedir</code> option to <code>gpg</code> to point it at the mount location. This is better than just keeping the master lying around day-to-day, but still pretty unideal as I'm exposing it to a potentially compromised, non-airgapped computer. Therefore I plan to get a Raspberry Pi (or something similar) and put it in the safe so I can use it as a fully trusted computer that's never been connected to the internet (and is therefore <em>very</em> hard to compromise). I'll keep the Pi in the safe to provide greater assurance that it hasn't been tampered with, as well as to provide a physical level of redundancy for the key material's security. This will hopefully happen Real Soon Nowâ¢ - I can't wait!</p>

This is of course, perfectly natural, and is why we do Pull Request reviews in the first place. But have you ever thought it was actually the <em>maintainer</em> doing the review who was wrong?</p>
<p>I'm the maintainer of a number of open source/free software projects and I have a message for you: <strong><em>tell this to the maintainer</em>, even if you're new, even if you feel like you have no idea what you're doing</strong>.</p>
<p>I'm sure to some people more experienced this sounds like obvious advice, but when you're new to this stuff getting feedback can be really scary. Maintainers have often spent years in the free software community and are super comfortable with how things work, not to mention that they might be more experienced in the language or framework their project uses. So it's super easy to just take their word as gospel. But I think it's super important to remember that everyone's human just like everyone else, and <em>everyone</em> has something to learn.</p>
<p>As a concrete example, take <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/pull/1310#issuecomment-291554491">this comment</a> on a Pull Request I received. If you read it and the following comment, I seem like an expert on <code>eval()</code>, but what you don't see until you read all the way to the bottom is that I spent about 20 minutes composing that comment because I had to double-check MDN to make sure I was actually correct. And honestly, that was <em>great</em>. That Pull Request forced me to recheck what I thought about the way <code>eval()</code> worked, <em>and</em> the contributor learned from it too! So it ended up being a win-win. Even if I was wrong, that would have been great too, since I would've learned something new. Sometimes the thing being discussed is just a really tough or confusing problem, and getting feedback on a PR can be a really awesome chance for both you <em>and</em> the maintainer to collaborate more closely and figure it out together!</p>
<p>I'm sure this won't work in every community. But honestly, if it doesn't, the maintainer you're running into is probably an ass and not worth bothering with anyway. This is what doing things in the open is all about - <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">freedom 1</a>, after all, is "the freedom to study the source code and make changes", the operative word being "study". The fact that knowledge is shared out in the open with anyone who wants it is one of the most amazing parts of this community, and I want to encourage you to stay curious and ask lots of questions.</p>
<p>So if you've ever walked away from a Pull Request review feeling like something wasn't quite right, consider this your permission slip to politely <em>tell your reviewer you think they're wrong</em>[1] - just make sure to be polite and explain why you think so! And remember, whatever they say, they're not criticizing you personally. I hope you embrace it as an opportunity to grow.</p>
<p>Footnotes:</p>
<p>[1]: Phrasing this as "I think you're wrong" instead of "you're wrong" is great for a lot of reasons, but one notable and less obvious one is that if the maintainer <em>does</em> end up being right, you won't feel silly.</p>
<p><em>Edited to clarify that I'm not advocating inpoliteness, to change the phrasing to "I</em> think <em>you're wrong", and to add some nice framing around a chance to collaborate on a difficult problem. Thanks to the Recurse Center folks whose feedback turned into these changes, particularly <a href="https://www.harihareswara.net/">Sumana Harihareswara</a> and <a href="https://jvns.ca/">Julia Evans</a>.</em></p>

<p>5.1 stable <em>does</em> include one change the beta didn't: a bump to the version of the <code>gm</code> npm package which we depend on. This bump was done as a precautionary measure, as previous versions of <code>gm</code> depended on a version of the <code>debug</code> module which was vulnerable to denial-of-service security bugs.</p>
<p>As a project, we addressed these bugs <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2017/10/denial-of-service-security-fixes-now-available">back in October</a> when we issued security releases for all supported release branches, and at the time we confirmed that the vulnerable function wasn't used by <code>gm</code>. Today's <code>gm</code> bump does <em>not</em> constitute a security release; instead, we're just bumping the version as a precautionary measure in case we missed something in October's assessment of the situation.</p>
<p>Aside from the <code>gm</code> bump, there are (as usual) miscellaneous version bumps included in this release. We've also started tracking test suite coverage information as well as overhauled our <a href="https://pumpio.readthedocs.io/">documentation on ReadTheDocs</a>, moving most of the in-repository documentation there.</p>
<p>If you want even more details of this release, you can also check out <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#510---2018-01-05">the changelog</a>.</p>
<p>pump 5.1 is a drop-in replacement for 5.0. That means if you're using our recommended installation method and installing from npm, you can upgrade with <code>npm install -g pump.io@5.1</code>. If you have a source-based install, you should merge and/or switch to the <code>v5.1.0</code> tag. And as always, if you encounter any problems, please feel free to reach out to the <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/wiki/Community">community</a> or <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/issues">file bugs you find</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't point out that pump.io has a <strong>brand-new announcement mailing list</strong>! While the blog is great for announcing new releases, not everyone finds it convenient to check. Also, if we issue new betas in the middle of a release cycle, these aren't typically announced on the blog. Therefore in the future <em>all</em> new releases will be announced on the mailing list, not just initial betas. If you want to subscribe to the mailing list, you may do so <a href="https://lists.strugee.net/mailman/listinfo/pumpio-announce">here</a> - you'll get announcements of new features only, not e.g. feature announcements as seen on this blog. I hope people find this service useful!</p>
